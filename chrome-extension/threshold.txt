1 cup all purpose flour measure with the fluff/scoop/and level method

instructions
preheat oven to 425f
if you are using the parsley, put it in the bowl of a processor and pulse till evenly chopped.
put the dry ingredients in the bowl of the processor, pulse to mix.
drop in the butter pieces and pulse about 10 times to incorporate the butter.
mix together the honey and buttermilk and while the processor is going, pour the liquids in and run just until the dough forms.
dump it out onto a floured surface and pat it into a fat disk, about 9", don't be worried by the sticky dough, all you are doing is patting it into shape and plopping the biscuits on the baking sheet, so you don't need to add too much extra flour.
cut out 6 biscuits with a 2 1/2 to 2 3/4 inch biscuit cutter.  reform the dough gently and cut 2 more biscuits if you want, although i always find the biscuits made with the reformed dough are not nearly as good or as pretty.
bake on parchment or silpat mat for about 5 to 6 minutes until the biscuits start to rise, and then turn down the heat to 400 and bake another 8 to 10 minutes just until fully risen and lightly browned.  don't over bake!
instructions

tBoiled Codfish Dinner
Cozido à Portuguesa
Mariana Raposo
Boiled dinners are traditional fare in New England and are usually associated with corned beef and cabbage, Boston Irish and St. Patrick's day. This cozido is the Portuguese version and is just the ticket when only a hot, homey meal will do.
1 lb. cod fish
2 or 3 large potatoes, peeled and quartered
1 large sweet potato, peeled and quartered
1 large onion, quartered
Garlic to taste
1 bay leaf
Place all the ingredients together in a large kettle, cover with water and bring to the boil. Reduce the heat and cook until the potatoes are tender and the fish flakes.
Serve with steamed broccoli and some olive oil and vinegar to sprinkle over the fish and potatoes.
Serves 4.

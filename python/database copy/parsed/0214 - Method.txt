In medium bowl, place chicken. In small bowl, combine mayonnaise, green chilies, garlic, hot sauce (if using) and black pepper. Stir into chicken. 
Prepare Miracle Dough Tortillas. Place some of the chicken mixture down the center of the tortilla, top generously with grated cheese and fold the long sides of the mixture over the filling, pinching the tortilla closed with your fingers and then fold a small portion of the top and bottom of the tortilla over the filling as well (again pinching it to seal), making a cute parcel.
In large nonstick frying pan, fry tortillas on both sides until golden brown. You can hold the tortilla on its side using 2 spatulas if you would like the sides cooked as well, although the texture contrast is quite pleasing, so not completely essential to do this. Serve with sour cream, if desired.

Instructions
1. Soften the rhubarb for 10 to 15 minutes by simmering it in a few tablespoons of water over medium heat.
2. Remove the rhubarb when it begins to fall apart, and place it in a blender, food processor, or large bowl.
3. Add all remaining ingredients and blend together until a chunky puree is formed. (If youâ€™re working by hand, just toss everything together well.)
4. Adjust seasonings.
5. To ferment, if desired, stir the whey or sauerkraut brine into the salsa, then spoon into a quart-sized Mason jar.
6. Let sit at room temperature for 1 to 2 days, then store in the refrigerator for 3 to 4 weeks.
7. While this salsa can be eaten immediately, it does taste significantly better if let sit for a few days, so let it sit if you have the time.

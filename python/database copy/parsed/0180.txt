Smoky Vegan Cheese (Three Ways)
GFVGVDFNS
Jump to Recipe
The thing about cheese is, I love it. However, my body is like ‚Äúah, nah.‚Äù
The thing about this Cashew-less Vegan Queso is, it‚Äôs delicious. But my watch is like ‚Äúah, nah.‚Äù
The thing about this recipe is, it takes 10 minutes and tastes like the real deal. Ah, yeah.
I absolutely adore eggplant and cashew cheeses, but the time commitment is a little too much for everyday use. So one day I started to wonder if you could make vegan ‚Äúparmesan‚Äù but with Mexican-inspired flavors. Answer? Yes.
Then, I wondered if you could add that back to the processor and make cheesy cashew butter spread. Answer? Yes.
Finally, I wondered if you could add hot water to that spread and make 10-minute pourable queso with no soaking or roasting involved. Answer? DOUBLE YES. Friends, this is a major win in my book.
The first way: Shakeable!
Add raw cashews, nutritional yeast, salt, cumin, chili powder and garlic powder to a food processor and blitz away.
Ta-da! You have shakeable spiced, Vegan Cheese, perfect for salads, tofu scrambles, tacos, and more.
Now that‚Äôs some adobo, bro. Learn about adobo and its origins here!
Add the same ingredients as the shakeable cheese to the food processor with a little olive oil and you have a sexy looking spread. A chipotle pepper in adobo sauce takes it to the next level with a smoky, spicy wave of flavor.
This version is perfect as a dip, sandwich spread, or base layer in burritos. But we‚Äôre not done yet.
Add some hot water to the spreadable cheese and we‚Äôve got queso!
This version is perfect for virtually any Mexican-inspired dish, especially nachos, burritos, taco salads, and dips. Sit tight because I‚Äôve got a recipe coming next week using this version that makes _thee_ perfect healthy vegan snack for parties, game days and lazy afternoon lounging. Can‚Äôt wait!
If you make this recipe in any form, please let us know! Leave a comment below, or tag a photo minimalistbaker on Instagram. We‚Äôd love to see what you come up with. Cheers!

Does it keep? 10 Days
Ingredients
US Customary ‚Äì Metric
FOR THE SHAKEABLE:
3/4 cup raw cashews
3 Tbsp nutritional yeast
1/2 tsp sea salt
1/4 tsp garlic powder
1/2 tsp cumin
1/4 tsp chili powder
FOR THE SPREAD:
1 1/2 cups raw cashews
3 Tbsp nutritional yeast
1/2 tsp sea salt
1/4 tsp garlic powder
1/2 tsp cumin
1 pinch chili powder
1 chipotle in adobo with a little sauce (or sub salsa or your favorite hot sauce)
1 Tbsp olive or avocado oil (for blending // _optional_ )
FOR THE QUESO:
1 cup of the spreadable + hot water
Instructions
To make the shakeable cheese, add all ingredients to a food processor and pulse until a fine meal is achieved (see photo). Store in a jar and refrigerate, and use on anything from tacos to salads to tofu scrambles.
To make the spreadable cheese, add raw cashews to a food processor and process into a butter, scraping down sides as needed. Add in spices and chipotle pepper and mix until until a spread is formed. You may need to add a little oil to help things blend together. Store in a jar and refrigerate to keep fresh, and use as a dip or spread.
To make the queso, simply scoop out desired portion of the spreadable cheese and add very hot water a little at a time and whisk until pourable. Use as a dip, tacos and salads. Store leftovers in a jar in the fridge to keep fresh.
Notes
Nutrition information is a rough estimate for 2 Tbsp of the shakeable cheese (which yields a total of 6 servings). For estimates on the spread and queso, roughly double those numbers per serving due to increased volume/weight. 
Recipe as originally written yields ~2 cups cheese. 
Learn more about the origins of queso here, which takes inspiration from Southwest cuisine and classic Mexican flavors.

Hi there 
I‚Äôm making right now. I know I made this before but added salsa instead of chipotle in Adobe 
I‚Äôm following the spread directions and it‚Äôs quite thick and crumbly if that makes sense. It didn‚Äôt happen before but I think I added quite a bit of salsa 
Should I add some hot water to thin it out more adobe liquid or salsa. ? Tnx so much 
Making it just to put on some crackers but would use for tostitos dipping as well. Tnx :)

I made the spread using 1/2 cup raw cashews and 1 cup cooked drained garbanzo beans. I processed the cashews first. They never quite made it to smooth cashew butter, but they did release their oils making it easier to blend. Then I added the garbanzos and the other ingredients. And to make it blend better I added a little of the bean liquid (instead of oil). It‚Äôs really good, probably not as rich as using all cashews, but I wanted it to have less fat content. Great as a sandwich spread or dip. Sort of like a queso/hummus. Thanks for the recipe!

I made this and my partner and I really like it! The only element we‚Äôd like to improve is that it‚Äôs very sweet ‚Äì I think the cashews just bring a sweetness that‚Äôs difficult to cut. We used raw cashews (and didn‚Äôt soak it or anything, missed that in your recipe). We tried adding some acidity in the form of hot sauce, but it‚Äôs still so sweet. Do you have any recommendations? Overall we really like it, though, and think it would be super tasty with beans and avocado.

I made the queso version for your 7 layer dip, awesome flavors ‚Äì I‚Äôve been eating the leftovers for lunches this week with tortilla chips! It didn‚Äôt turn out exactly pourable like yours looks, I think it was my bad for adding the water and mixing it with the food processor instead of a whisk. The texture was more like a hummus, but still delicious. Do you have any tips/recipes to use up the rest of the Chipotle peppers? Do you know how long they‚Äôll last in the refrigerator? Thanks!

I take the chipotles and sauce and put in a container add unsweetnened vegan milk and process with my emersion blender. Then I freeze in small containers to use later on. It freezes soft so you can actually scrape it out with a spoon to use to spice up any recipe and add smokiness. then put right back in freezer.

I place leftover chipotles in an ice cube tray (1 per cube) and divide the adobo across them. Once frozen, they store well in a freezer bag or airtight container.

So I‚Äôm trying to be vegan for a month, and out of nowhere this MAJOR craving for nachos hit me HARD. Found this recipe, didn‚Äôt have any nutritional yeast so I subbed it with soya sauce at just under half (1.5 tablespoon) of what the recipe called for nutritional yeast. Thinned it out with some hot water, poured it over my tortilla chips, dumped in some salsa and BAM! I licked the whole bowl clean in 5 seconds. Couldn‚Äôt even tell the difference for the life of me! And I‚Äôm one of those people who turns her nose up in the air with vegan substitutes saying ‚ÄúI can tell a little bit of difference‚Äù. Not only was my tummy happy with neutralizing the craving, but it was also SO happy that it wasn‚Äôt real cheese (I‚Äôm lacto-sensitive). Going to make another batch now! 
In case it got lost in the word dump: sub nutritional yeast with soy sauce at 2:1 ratio! It works well!

Hello! I want you to know that I love your website & youtube channel! You inspire me to cook more plant-based, despite my steak-loving husband. I‚Äôm going to slowly work meatless monday into our diets and get him used to some plant proteins. I used to be vegan/veggie and never ate red meat, but now I eat steak almost regularly. I‚Äôm actually concerned about my cholestrol, to be honest.. lol but anyway, I have a question! I made some nacho cheese yesterday, a different recipe, but it was cashews, water, and nutritional yeast and yielded 3 cups. I have 2 cups leftover, and I don‚Äôt know if I can finish it by the end of the week. How long will it stay good for in the fridge? The girls are coming over next Thursday and I‚Äôm planning on doing vegan mexican (hello black bean taquitos) with my cashew queso. Will it be bad by then? Can I freeze it and then dethaw in the fridge and warm it up in a saucepan? If I can‚Äôt use it and have to make a new batch, I‚Äôm going to try your recipe here. Thanks so much!

I made this last night because I‚Äôm throwing my engagement party today and want to make the pinwheels. It firmed up a lot over night. When I tried to spread it, it seemed very dry. What‚Äôs the best way to get this ready to use? Should I put it back in the vita mix and add a little hot water or oil? Or should I just try to leave it out to soften. It tastes great, but the texture isnt going to spread I fear. I don‚Äôt want to ruin it!

I just made the recipe for the spread, following the posted directions. I processed the cashews for quite a while ‚Äì they did not get to the paste stage. I added the rest of the ingredients, and the whole thing ended up in a tight ball in my processor. It took 3Tbs. of olive oil to loosen it up enough to spread, but the consistency is smooth, and the taste is delicious. Thanks for a good recipe!

How well does the queso do sitting out? When it cools does it get really thick and not queso-y? I have a potluck event coming up and I‚Äôd want to bring this as my appetizer, but if we‚Äôre leaving it out while playing board games, and someone tries it after it‚Äôs been on the table, is it going to be gluey and unappetizing?

This was very tasty! I‚Äôve been searching for good vegan cheese recipes because I‚Äôve even missing that kick on my food. I made the spread version with salsa because that‚Äôs what I had. I‚Äôd like it to be a little smoother, but it just wasn‚Äôt happening. Still delicious and I can‚Äôt wait to make a burrito with it soon!

I made the dip and it worked exactly right in my food processor. (I was worried I should use my Nutribullet since that‚Äôs what I use for cashew creams). I needed to add about 2 teaspoons of oil and the soaked cashews came together. I added the hot water to the food processor and kept it going, turned out just right and tasted very good. Also added a little turmeric for color. Definitely will make it again, thanks.

Insanely delish! I finally got hold of some nutritional yeast (don‚Äôt see it much in the UK) and wanted to give it a whirl. As a spread I found it a little oily, as a dip I had to pour some into a little bowl before I gobbled the whole lot. Just gorgeous! I am not even a vegan, just a vegetarian that is a bit weird about eggs and doesn‚Äôt like commercial farming. Last night I made a double batch of flaxseed crackers and these were just divine for dipping‚Ä¶‚Ä¶

Hi! I just wanted to say THANK YOU so much! I haven‚Äôt even tried your recipes yet and I already want to buy stock in you (if that were possible). I have been struggling with trying to go vegan and there are so many yummy looking things but they take all these ingredients that only NASA has heard of or they take 4,857,345,987 normal ingredients, a degree from Le Cordon Bleu, and 792 hours of straight mixing, chopping, peeling, mashing, standing on your head, putting one foot in and one foot out, etc. So, I am was beyond ecstatic (as if you couldn‚Äôt tell) when I came across your simple recipes! Again, thank you so much for sharing these!

I made this and added the hot water and the oil separated from the cashews‚Ä¶ I also made the eggplant cheese version but left out the salsa. I made both of them the night before (I didn‚Äôt care that the eggplant one wouldn‚Äôt look great one of them was going to be a part of a vegan 7-layer dip, but I wanted to taste both, and they tasted amazing! I ate a bunch of the eggplant one like cheese soup. In the morning, I gave the cashew one a stir, and it was very stiff and the oil was still separated. I decided to blend a spoon of both and mix and see what happened, and wow! Even one step better! So I ended up blending the eggplant cheese into the Mexican cashew cheese together till it was to the right consistency to put into a vegan 7 layer dip. Everyone at the BBQ ate up my dip before most people even knew it was there. I‚Äôm making another batch for 4th of July!

After adding the water for the pourable cheese, the texture just wasn‚Äôt right for me, so I added ~2tsp tapioca powder and stirred constantly over medium heat and eventually the sauce came together in a perfect melty-cheesy way.

This looks amazing and all the comments have given me great ideas for customizing to my taste. A Question: will the queso bake well in the oven, or should I add to the top of my casserole once I take it out of the oven. I cook my casserole at 400 degrees for 15-20 minutes. 
Thank you for all your recipes: I cannot wait to fill my pantry with the staples to try them

It sounds like you used the wrong kind of yeast. If you used active yeast, that definitely makes sense that it would rise up in volume. Nutritional yeast is different from the active yeast you would use in dough recipes and doesn‚Äôt rise.

I used the spreadable version on Pizza as a cheese substitute! It was so good. I made two improvements to the recipe for pizza topping. Blend some corn starch into the paste before you crumble it over the pizza. Then, before you put it in the oven, paint the entire thing with a bit of semi-melted vegan margarine. When the pizza is almost done switch it to the broiler for 3 minutes. You would swear it was a melted / roasted feta or soft cheese on top.

Made this on Sunday, going for the queso version that I could nom on with some homemade (or at least home chipped) tortilla chips. My boyfriend can‚Äôt eat dairy, so I wanted to treat him to a non-dairy version of something we used to snack on back in the day. Unfortunately, he‚Äôs been too sick to have any. This is only the second vegan cheesy thing I‚Äôve made (the other being an alfredo made of cauliflower). I don‚Äôt really eat cheese myself even though I can, so I can‚Äôt give a good comparison. I rather enjoyed this fresh. Made it with salsa since I had some on hand already. I can‚Äôt give a worthwhile review of it after being in the fridge for a while because my chips have gone bad. They‚Äôre like leather, making eating them a chore. I did microwave a few scoops of this and maybe it‚Äôs because I put it in for too long, but it did not work well. It turned into a crumbly dough, almost like it wanted to be a mug cake or something. lol I might try alternate means of heating, like making nachos in the oven or something. Thanks for the recipe!

Fantastic queso! I‚Äôve made this quite a few times. I use boiling water to soak the cashews and find that works best for me. I also add extra garlic and a bit of cayenne for a spicier kick since my family likes the heat.

This looks like an incredible recipe! I can‚Äôt wait to try the queso in particular, but I have two questions to ensure maximum deliciousness.
1) Do you recommend I soak the cashews before making the queso? If so, how does it change the taste/texture/etc. of the final product?

Jennifer, my husband has had Crohns, as well, for over 20 years‚Äîat 27, he had a perforated bowel, leading to a small intestinal resection (i.e., removing a foot of his small intestine). Making the shift from vegetarian to vegan was what turned the corner for him. He never eats dairy or eggs (or meat, of course), and rarely has gut problems.

I made the queso tonight with quesadillas. It was delicious! My fianc√© said they were the best quesadillas I ever made. :) Cashews for the win!

I was doing a search on this site and came upon this ‚ÄúMexican cheese‚Äù the color of cheese whiz. Please rename this to ‚Äúqueso,‚Äù and refrain from calling it ‚ÄúMexican.‚Äù Mexico offers a variety of cheese, none of which include Velveeta or its neighbors. Queso as the dip is a texmex invention, although i am sure none of us Texans would mistake it for actual ‚Äúcheese.‚Äù Thx!

I‚Äôve been making your eggplant queso, which I love! I also have an annoying sensitivity to cashews, as another commenter mentioned, so if I try these I will use perhaps macadamia nuts. Thank you for all your brilliant ideas. Whenever I pin yet another one, I usually add that to my tag- ‚ÄúAnother brilliant idea from Minimalist Baker‚Äù!

Hey, can anyone tell me if the Macadamia nuts (or, if not, ANYTHING ELSE) work for this? I thought I was the only person in the world who can‚Äôt eat cashews, but having finally seen at least one other person with this issue I have hope. What nut works well in place of cashews for vegan cheese???? THANK YOU!

Leslie says

I haven‚Äôt tried the Macadamia nuts yet, but have read lots of vegan cheese recipes, and many of them indicate that they can be a good alternative (as well as pine nuts and sunflower seeds). But I have never tried soaking cashews first, which some people have indicated can help with digestibility. If you have an allergy, don‚Äôt even try. But I just have mild intestinal discomfort, so soaking overnight is something I plan on trying. 
And you are not alone. Many, many people cannot eat Cashews. I don‚Äôt think a food exists that someone somewhere is not allergic to.

In my mind somewhere (because my best friend is Vegan) I would like to become Vegan, but cheese is my most loved LOVED food, especially with Mexican food. 
You may have just solved my problem of conversion to Vegan. 
Your recipe has made my day. I‚Äôm sharing with my friend, printing your recipe out and I‚Äôm going to try it this weekend! Thank you. So glad I found your website today. I‚Äôve subscribed!!

I have a question about the raw cashews. Are they soaked over night or for a couple of hours before they are used? I would love to try this recipe today!! 
Thank you

March 7, 2015 at 8:05 pm
Overnight is best! Or, pour boiling hot water over them and soak for 1 hour, then drain!

Good morning!!! I followed the recipe for spread which turned out good, but when I attempted to make the queso it did not turn out so good. I added the hot water a little at a time. It turned it a pasty color and it lost all of its flavor. Im not sure what i did wrong.

I soaked raw cashews overnight but then was unable to use them the next day. I drained them and refrigerated them and completely forgot about them. That was over a week ago. Do you know if they‚Äôre still OK to use?
Maggie B says

But it isnt said to soak in the recipe, is it needed/better to do so?

Phew! Thank you for the quick save about the boiling water soak for cashews! Didn‚Äôt know about the boiling water trick. Forgot to soak overnight, so will give it a try!

Can you use cashew butter instead? I won‚Äôt be able to run to the store but I already have the butter!

I have subbed sunflower seeds for the cashews in her shakey parm because I didn‚Äôt have any on hand, and my family loved it. Maybe that would work in this recipe? In fact, I think I‚Äôm going to go try it. (sunflower seeds are cheaper, too!)

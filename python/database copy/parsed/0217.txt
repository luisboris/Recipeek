Lamb Koftas with Tzatziki 
Leave a Comment
Lamb Koftas are delicious and silly easy to make. This is simple food at its best. 
Serve with pitta bread and tzatziki and if like me, you love Greek salad, add it as a side dish.

Lamb Koftas Kebabs
I love both Greek and Turkish food and I find that I already have most of the spices and so apart from the fresh produce I'm all set to go. 
Kebabs are my favourite, especially homemade Doner Kebabs and I'm pretty sure I could live on Moussaka!
Spices such as cumin, coriander, cinnamon and paprika are used in other popular cuisines such as Mexican food and we do love a good Chilli con Carne and so I always have them in my cupboard. 
What are Lamb Koftas?
Koftas refers to a dish made with spiced ground meat (mince). Sometimes it’s made on skewers as in this recipe but they do also come without using skewers and are shaped like a torpedo, or round like a football. 
Typically, they are stuffed inside flatbreads with fresh salad or pickled vegetables and sauces, although they can be served with a simple salad. 
Tzatziki
Start by making the tzatziki. Put the grated cucumber in a fine-mesh sieve and drain over a bowl for at least 1 hour but longer if you can. If you don't do this, your tzatziki will be watery. 
How to make Lamb Koftas
Mix the spices and herbs with the lamb mince. Season and fry a tiny amount so you can taste and adjust the seasoning if needed. 
Divide the mixture and shape around your wooden skewers. 
Mix the drained cucumber and the rest of the tzatziki ingredients together in a bowl. 
If you don't like dill you can use mint instead; or a mixture of both! Just be sure to only add the fresh herbs when you're ready to serve or they will discolour. 
Grill the koftas, get the pitta bread ready and whip a Greek salad and you're all set to dive in!

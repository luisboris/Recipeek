palak paratha recipe | spinach paratha recipe | palak ka paratha with step by step photo and video. it is always challenging to prepare something healthy and yet which matches our taste buds. especially during early busy mornings when it comes to pack for lunch boxes. but here is simple, tasty and full of rich nutrients paratha recipe is which is purely prepared from green palak or spinach.
i have shared quite a few paratha recipes till now but out of all palak paratha is my new favourite recipe. there are 2 main reasons for it. firstly, out of all the other paratha recipes, this is a simple and hassle free _paratha recipes_. blanch and create a puree from palak and mix it with the dough and the spinach paratha is ready. secondly, i just love the green color of all palak recipes. hence i always make sure there is a bunch of palak in my fridge every time.
while the recipe is extremely simple, but still there are several ways to prepare this amazing palak paratha. the other most common way is to prepare it by mixing finely chopped palak or spinach leaves directly to wheat dough. this is the easiest way of preparing spinach paratha , but you may feel raw smell of palak leaves. the other way is to simply prepare the puree of spinach without blanching it. even this looks simple, but you may have a raw smell of palak while consuming.
finally i would like to highlight my other paratha recipes collection with this post. especially, paneer paratha, aloo paratha, aloo cheese paratha, gobi paratha, mooli paratha, methi thepla, lachha paratha, kerala parota and aloo kulcha recipe. in addition do visit my other recipes collection like,

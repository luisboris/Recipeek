Savory Winter Vegetable Galette with Feta Cheese (whole-wheat)
February 19, 2020Appetizer, Sides, PiesHaley HansenComment
When the brutal winter days barge in, you’ve now got a delicious baking project to keep you busy in the kitchen. This Savory Winter Vegetable Galette with Feta Cheese has a tender, flaky crust topped with roasted seasonal vegetables and tangy feta cheese. Isn’t it beautiful?!_
Alright, change. Maybe you and I could become close friends, or at least closer than we were before. Maybe, after consecutive whacks in the face of change, I can learn to grab a hold of the incoming change and follow its path of motion, rather than try to fight it and force it in the opposite direction.
Twiddling my thumbs and biting the tip of my pen, staring blankly at my computer screen in my bedroom and digging through recipe ideas stored away in my brain’s messy, cluttered file cabinet only to come across an empty file folder, it dawned on me - am I out of ideas for sweets recipes? Why isn’t anything inspiring me these days? Aside from the fluffy, cozy, seasonal cinnamon rolls lush with creamy frosting, no sweets recipe I could imagine got me up and running to the kitchen to tie on my apron the way they used to.
Oh my gosh. Am I over? Is Hungry Haley stale like a weeks-old batch of cookies? Hopeless, tasteless, uninspiring. Just like I felt.
Inhale. Exhale. To escape the self-deprecating black hole I could’ve fallen into in that moment, I walked over to Dad’s office and asked him for dinner ideas for that night. In _that_ moment, imagining sitting around the table with my parents - my two favorite people on the planet - after an hour or two in the kitchen cooking something with fresh herbs and spices, seasonal vegetables and whole grains, and juicy, tender, savory meat, I felt hopeful, tasteful, and incredibly inspired. With that, I ran to the kitchen to tie on my apron the way I used to.
I’m new to the savory side of the kitchen, like I was new to the distance track team as a senior in high school and new to the nutrition major as a junior in college. I’ve been here before, but for short, sweet and simple visits to quickly return to the sweet side and pick up my spatula and muffin tin. My success here is unknown, but it’s in my hands, like it was each time I laced up my running shoes to race against highly competitive runners and each time I walked into classes with students who knew each other and carried science-forward brains.
In all three of these situations, I’ve been driven. Not fearless. Just passionate and intuitive.
So much of this blog is for you, the readers - the photos, the recipes (including each and every trial, error, and edit), the analytics. One piece for me is the fact that it is mine, that this blog can be whatever I want it to be, whatever God calls me to in any moment. If I want to bake a batch of chocolate-chunk-studded brown butter cookies, I sure as heck can. If I want to whip up a flaky, tender galette with roasted seasonal vegetables and tangy feta cheese, I sure as heck can do that, too. I can embrace change! Finally!
Finallyyyy! Change tastes good.
NOTES:_
If you can’t find whole-wheat pastry flour (also known as white whole-wheat flour), use half-whole wheat flour and half all-purpose flour._
Try swapping the butternut squash for sweet potato, if you’d like! There is room for flexibility there. The same goes for the chopping method - I chose thin slices because I thought this shape would work best for eating (as opposed to dicing, for example), but you can chop the squash/sweet potato however you’d like. Just be sure to keep an on them while roasting to prevent anything from burning or cooking unevenly._
Do not. Overwork. The dough. Right when it comes together after you’ve added the water, you should be cautious of overworking because the water has now come into contact with the gluten, therefore increasing the potential for a tough crust. Roll the dough out, create the layer as described in the instructions, and refrigerate. Keep it simple - this will yield a tender, buttery, and ever-so-flaky crust!_
RECIPE 
Makes about 12 squares
For the crust: 
1 ⅓ cup + 2 tablespoons whole-wheat pastry flour, plus more for dusting 
¾ cup unsalted grass-fed butter, chilled (1 ½ sticks) 
1 teaspoon sea salt 
2-3 tablespoons ice-cold water 
1 egg, beaten, or 2 tablespoons heavy cream, for brushing the crust 
For the vegetable filling: 
½ medium butternut squash, peeled and thinly sliced into discs 
1 cup curly kale, roughly torn (stems removed) 
¼ red onion, thinly sliced 
2 cloves garlic, minced 
2 tablespoons unsalted grass-fed butter 
1 tablespoon olive oil 
Salt and pepper, to taste 
6 oz. havarti cheese, shredded 
⅓ cup crumbled feta cheese 
Fresh basil, for garnish 
Crushed red pepper flakes, optional
1. Make the crust. Cube the butter into roughly ¼-inch size cubes and chill until very cold. In a bowl, stir together the flour and sea salt and add the cubed butter, tossing to coat. You can use a pastry cutter to cut the cubes into smaller pieces and work them into the flour or you can use your hands. I prefer to use my hands because I can get a better feel for when the butter is fully incorporated, but this does require some more manual labor. When the butter is incorporated into the flour - about pea-sized and the flour clumps together - drizzle 2 tablespoons ice cold water over the dough and gently work this in with your hands. If the dough is still dry, add the last tablespoon and work it in again until just combined. The dough should easily come together in one large mass. 
2. Turn the pastry dough out onto a lightly floured clean surface. Pull the dough together into one lump and begin rolling it out with a rolling pin until its about ½-inch thick all the way around. Fold the dough over on itself and press down, pinching the edges in to create a somewhat clean rectangle. Repeat this process to create a square. Wrap tightly with plastic wrap and refrigerate for 2-24 hours. 
3. While the dough chills, prepare the vegetable filling. Preheat the oven to 425F and line a baking sheet with parchment paper. 
4. To prepare the butternut squash, slice the ends off and then cut the squash in half, leaving the rounder bottom portion for another occasion. Slice the top half down the middle, length-wise, and then each half into 3-4 portions about 1 inch thick. Peel the skin off and thinly slice each semi circle disc into about 5 slices. Brush these with olive oil, season with salt and pepper, and spread out on the baking sheet. Bake for 12 minutes on each side (24 minutes total, flipping them over halfway through) and then broil for 3 more minutes, or until golden brown and just barely crispy around the edges. Remove from the oven and set aside to cool completely. 
5. While the butternut squash cooks, prepare the kale. Peel the leaves off the stem (you’ll use about 2 stems here) and then tear them into pieces no larger than 1-2 inches. Heat the butter and oil in a large cast-iron skillet over medium heat until lightly sizzling, then add the sliced red onion and turn the heat to low immediately. Cook the onion, stirring occasionally, until softened and almost caramelized, about 5-6 minutes. Add the minced garlic and the kale and continue stirring as the kale wilts. Once the kale is cooked through - dark green and wilted - turn off the heat and transfer the vegetables to a plate to cool completely. 
6. Set the chilled crust dough on the countertop for a few minutes to soften just a bit before you begin shaping. Meanwhile, lightly flour a clean work surface and prepare a baking sheet with parchment paper. Preheat the oven to 375F. 
7. Use a rolling pin to whack (yes, whack) the dough to help soften it before rolling. You can also gently squeeze it with your hands. Begin rolling the dough into a rectangle, patching up any edges that begin to crack. You want the crust to be about a ¼-½ inch thick. Transfer the crust to the prepared baking sheet. 
8. Next, sprinkle the grated havarti cheese over the dough, leaving only a small amount of blank space around the very edge. This is important when the crust is folded over - by sprinkling the cheese closer to the edge (but not all the way), it ensures that some cheese will remain stuffed into the crust. Very tasty. 
9. Alternating between the squash and the kale, layer the vegetables over the cheese in two columns, slightly overlapping each layer. See the photos for reference. Next, fold the crust over so that the edge of the crust touches the outer edge of each column of vegetables. Make sure some of the cheese stays inside the crust! Beat the egg and brush this over the crust to create a golden crisp. 
10. Transfer the baking sheet to the oven and bake for 28-30 minutes, or until the crust turns a deep golden color and feels firm to the touch. Remove from the oven and cool completely on the baking sheet before cutting. 
11. Sprinkle the fresh chopped basil and salt and pepper over the top, and slice into 12 squares to serve. Store leftovers in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 5 days. Enjoy!

bull;&bull;
a little Thursday morning treat with my guy &amp; the pup 🥰
bull;&bull;
cardigandonuts are now sold at @frgmntcoffee in North Loop! we both went for a simple black coffee &amp; thought the roast was so tasty. &amp; of course, the donuts 💯
blueberry riesling jelly-filled \(incredible\)
FRGMNT inspired donut
classic glazed old-fashioned \(the key to my heart\)
bull;&bull;
best 👏🏼 homemade 👏🏼 sweet potato 👏🏼 wedges 👏🏼 even the bf loves them - he came back for seconds! I also think the colors are just gorgeous before baking, but swipe to see the drool-worthy after photo 💯
bull;&bull;
RECIPE \(basically just a how-to because it&rsquo;s so simple\):
1. preheat the oven to 450F &amp; line a baking sheet with parchment or a silicone baking mat.
2. chop the sweet potato into wedges about 1/2-inch thick all around. toss in 1-2 tbsp. oil, or enough to lightly coat all surfaces of the wedges. toss in salt, pepper, &amp; garlic powder. 
3. bake for 20 minutes, then flip the wedges.
4. bake for 10-12 more minutes, or until browned on at least 1 side &amp; tender. they will continue to cook once out of the oven, so it&rsquo;s okay to take them out when they don&rsquo;t feel fully tender yet. 
lower-body - emphasis on quad &amp; glute 💪🏼🍑 in the @balanceathletica leggings that I just cannot get enough of!
bull;&bull;
this is my favorite lower body workout! it&rsquo;s tough, but with the circuit format, I finish in just 30 minutes. the only equipment needed are dumbbells &amp; a heavy resistance band! 
bull;&bull;
repeat each circuit 4x, resting for 1 min after each round.
CIRCUIT 1:
DB RDL x15
top-loaded DB squat x15
DB sumo squat x15
sumo squat pulse x15 \(this is where it really🔥\)
bull;&bull;
CIRCUIT 2:
banded top-loaded DB squat x15
banded lateral squat walks x15
banded squat jumps x15
bull;&bull;
my new favorite \(veggie-packed!\) breakfast: fried eggs over crispy roasted sweet potatoes &amp; spinach. add avocado, cream cheese, hummus, or even a quick aioli for extra flavor &amp; dippableness 👍🏼
bull;&bull;
your strength, power, &amp; purpose come from within. 🤍 ItsWithinUs
bull;&bull;
i think it&rsquo;s important to lean on loved ones &amp; seek professional help when we need it. I also think it&rsquo;s important to remember that we know ourselves better than anyone else, &amp; that we are stronger than we may think! 
bull;&bull;
on the blog today, I&rsquo;ve rounded up the habits I&rsquo;ve implemented to help me stay connected to myself &amp; strong from within:
an energizing morning routine 
journaling 
intentional time alone 
positive self-talk
linked in my bio!
bull;&bull;
I&rsquo;ve been hearing lots of &ldquo;how many calories did you burn?&rdquo; talk at the gym lately. did you know that the machines are not accurate, even when the user inputs their metrics? in fact, even your fitness tracker isn&rsquo;t going to be 100% accurate at measuring calorie burn. 
bull;&bull;
most importantly, when we focus only on the calorie burn during a workout, we miss out on all of the more sustainable &amp; fulfilling reasons to exercise, like:
improved digestion &amp; metabolism 
better quality sleep
enhanced mood &amp; cognition 
FUN! 
bull;&bull;
ldquo;the way you awaken makes a world of difference&rdquo; ✨ YES it certainly does! I&rsquo;m such a morning person already, but I also firmly believe in making the most out of my morning to start my day off on the right foot. gratitude journal + coffee + movement are my priorities 🤍
bull;&bull;
rounded up some of the words I&rsquo;m loving lately ☺️☝🏼 daily reminders, words of encouragement, little bites of inspiration - use them however you like! ✨
bull;&bull;

squeezed in a little &ldquo;me time&rdquo; at the gym this morning ☺️ it got me thinking - we don&rsquo;t always &ldquo;have&rdquo; time, but we can almost always make the time. sacrifices might be involved, but your physical &amp; mental health is important! 
bull;&bull;
there are no rules against drinking a protein shake out of a coffee mug from a brewery, right? 😂
bull;&bull;
my favorite chocolate-PB protein shake:
1 frozen banana
1 handful spinach 
1 handful of ice cubes 
1 tbsp natural peanut butter

bull;&bull;

the only person or thing with the power to make today &amp; this week good or bad is you, great or not so great is you. just because it&rsquo;s Monday doesn&rsquo;t mean it needs to be a &ldquo;Monday&rdquo;. you are in control of your mindset, &amp; that is so incredibly powerful! ✨💪🏼
bull;&bull;
last week was a very &ldquo;bleh&rdquo; week for me, so my focus this week is to just make it better 😂 
bull;&bull;
holy molyyyyy this 22-minute bodyweight AMRAP almost beat me this morning 😅 but NOPE I finished it 💪🏼 now it&rsquo;s your turn!
bull;&bull;
repeat each circuit AMRAP-style / 10 minutes.

every form of exercise provides some form of benefit\(s\) to the body &amp; mind. we could argue all day about which is &ldquo;better&rdquo; - going back &amp; forth between this benefit &amp; that benefit. but what matters MOST is what exercise YOU enjoy ☺️
bull;&bull;
made tater tot hot-dish today so, I think it&rsquo;s safe to say, I am OFFICIALLY a good Minnesotan. ☺️

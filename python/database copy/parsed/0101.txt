If you are craving a cookie to knock your socks off, look no further than these Soft Sugar Cookies.
They seriously are the BEST sugar cookies around!
I love a good cookie. Depending on what type of cookie it is, the textures of it needs to vary.
For chocolate chip cookies, I like them ooey gooey soft.
For oatmeal cookies, I prefer them thin and crisp.
But for these sugar cookies? I honestly love them either way!
When I‚Äôm saying that these are the BEST sugar cookies, they are! They are melt in your mouth goodness that you literally can‚Äôt stop eating. (Trust me‚Ä¶that‚Äôs a good thing!)
With the holidays coming up, there‚Äôs no better time than now to perfect your sugar cookie baking skills.
This recipe will have you baking like a pro in no time and you‚Äôll be granted the title ‚Äúcookie queen/king‚Äù as well.
Wow your friends and family this season by bringing a plate, or two of these delicious sugar cookies to the next family function.
As soon as you set the plate down on the table, hands will be grabbing them left and right!
My tip‚Ä¶
Bake an extra batch and leave them at home for you to enjoy later!
SUGAR COOKIES INGREDIENTS
To make these sugar cookies, you will need:
ALL-PURPOSE FLOUR: 2 1/2 cups of flour. It‚Äôs super important to measure the flour correctly. Too much or too little flour can change the consistency of the cookie.
BAKING SODA: 3/4 teaspoon baking soda. Make sure your baking soda is no more than 3 months old. If your using old baking soda, the cookies won‚Äôt rise properly and will be FLAT.
BAKING POWDER: just one teaspoon of baking powder. Again, make sure your baking powder is not too old or your cookies will come out FLAT and spread!
SALTED BUTTER: 1 cup ( 2 sticks) of salted butter. If you don‚Äôt have salted butter, I would add about 1/2-1 teaspoon of salt. Also, make sure your butter is at room temperature. If your butter is TOO WARM, it will also result in cookies that will SPREAD. So the best thing to do is let the butter sit out on the counter for at least 1 hour before you start baking and it will be perfect!
SUGAR: 1 1/4 cups granulated sugar. You will also need about 1/4 cup of granulated sugar, for rolling the dough balls in before baking them. 
EGG YOLKS: you will need 3 egg yolks. It‚Äôs very important that you separate the egg yolks, this recipe will NOT turn out if you use 3 whole eggs.
VANILLA EXTRACT: just one teaspoon.
HOW TO MAKE SUGAR COOKIES
To make these Soft Sugar Cookies, simply:
PRE-STEP: Preheat oven to 350F degrees. Line two large baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone baking mats. Set aside.
STEP 1: Whisk together the flour, baking soda, and baking powder in a medium-size bowl. Set aside.
STEP 2: In a large bowl, using an electric or stand mixer, cream together the butter, and granulated sugar until combined.
STEP 3: Add egg yolks and vanilla extract.
STEP 4: Add flour mixture and mix until just combined. DO NOT OVERMIX!
STEP 5: Using a cookie scoop or ice cream scoop, scoop dough into balls about 2 Tablespoons each, roll in sugar and place onto prepared baking sheet.
STEP 6: Bake for 10-15 minutes or until tops of cookies start to crack. Let cool for 5 minutes on baking sheet before moving them to a wire rack. Let cool completely on wire rack.
ADDITIONAL BAKING TIPS
DON‚ÄôT OVERMIX THE DOUGH: With almost all my cookie recipes, I always make sure to remind you to not OVERMIX the cookie dough. Meaning, when you mix the flour mixture into the wet ingredients, only mix them together until just combined‚Ä¶you should still see some flour in your mixing bowl.
HOW TO SCOOP THE PERFECT COOKIE: I always use a 1 Tablespoon cookie scoop, each cookie dough ball has ‚Äú2 scoops‚Äù of cookie dough, meaning that each cookie dough ball is 2 Tablespoons in size. In my opinion, this is the perfect sized cookie. If you don‚Äôt have a cookie scoop, you can use an ice cream scooper but you will only need 1 ice cream scoop of cookie dough.
And to make it super easier for you to learn how to scoop the perfect cookie, I created a step-by-step guide on How To Scoop The Perfect Cookie! 
WANT TO MAKE SUGAR CUT-OUT COOKIES: If your looking to make cut-out cookies, here is my recipe for the BEST Cut-Out Cookies. 
VANILLA BUTTERCREAM FROSTING: These cookies are delicious plain but if you want to add frosting on top. Here is my recipe for the best Sugar Cookie Frosting. 
BAKING TOOLS NEEDED
MIXER: I love my KitchenAid Mixer, I use it for everything. Makes baking so much easier!
BAKING SHEET: You will need a large 16√ó11 inch baking sheet.
SILICONE BAKING MAT OR PARCHMENT PAPER: If you don‚Äôt have a silicone baking mat‚Ä¶YOU NEED ONE!

These have been my favorite sugar cookies for years! Today I added a teaspoon of cinnamon to the dry ingredients and two teaspoons to the sugar for rolling. Way better than my usual sugar cookie recipe.

These cookies are wonderful. Everyone who tastes them thinks they are delicious. They don‚Äôt last more than 2 days at my house. My granddaughter takes them in her lunch and I have to add several more because her friends are begging for one.

I doubled this recipe to send to a party and left a dozen at home. That was the best tip! These are AMAZING. I can‚Äôt wait to make them again. Thank you so much for this recipe!

Are these still tasty if they arent rolled in sugar? Some of my family members do not like things that are too sugary.
Jennifer ‚Äî December 20, 2018 @ 3:40 pm Reply
Yes, they would taste fine without the rolling them in sugar!

Can you bake these from frozen, or should I thaw them first? I‚Äôm planning cookie trays for Christmas and am mixing/freezing dough to bake later. I pre rolled them into balls! Also, I added fresh cranberries, and the one I tested was amazing. I‚Äôm going to make orange zest frosting to top them off.
Jennifer ‚Äî November 30, 2018 @ 11:14 am Reply
Yes, you can bake them when frozen. They might take a couple minutes longer to bake. And adding cranberries with a orange frosting sounds AMAZING! Enjoy and Merry Christmas!

5 STARS!! I love my sugar cookies soft and fluffy, I wish I found this recipe years ago. I halved the recipe, & did not realize until writing this, that I still used 3 yolks instead of 1.5! Yet the cookies still came out so fluffy & melt in your mouth! So if you‚Äôre halving this, I think it‚Äôs safe to say you can use 2 egg yolks rather than go through the hassle of using half a yolk ‚Äì LOL. I didn‚Äôt roll in sugar as I use frosting for mine. I literally can‚Äôt stop eating them! I wish I made the full batch now! 
24. Holly ‚Äî June 26, 2018 @ 6:56 pm Reply
A trick I use when mixing the dry ingredients with the wet is using a spatula. Even though it takes more work and time it really helps to make sure you don‚Äôt over mix the dough. Thanks for the recipe it was delicious!

Is it OK to refrigerate the dough overnight? I was hoping to do so out of convenience and wanted to make sure the cookies would still turn out

These are soooo good! When I initially mixed the flour mixture to the wet, the consistency was really dry and crumbly. I just added an extra egg and the problem was solved! I live at a high altitude and some times have to tweak recipes to make them work way up here! I made these for my husbands pot luck tomorrow at work, but not before sneaking a couple for myself! üôÇ

Where did I go wrong‚Ä¶I followed the recipe to the exact details‚Ä¶ I found the mixture hard to mix. The balls were hard to make , the mixture was falling out of my hands. 
Hopefully my efforts with these cookies won‚Äôt end up in the garbage.
Jenn ‚Äî February 15, 2016 @ 12:40 pm Reply
If the mixture is hard to mix, that might mean that your butter wasn‚Äôt soft enough. If the butter is too cold it will not evenly mix into the dough causing the dough to be dry/crumbly.
48. Lynn ‚Äî February 4, 2016 @ 8:50 pm Reply
This is the best sugar cookie recipe on the internet. I have tried many that turned out pretty gross. Not these, every time I make these they come out perfect. Thank you for sharing these. Sugar cookies are my favorite cookies and now I can make them whenever I want.

Made these to feed my monthly beast(PMS) and they hit the spot! Sweet and FLUFFY! just what I was craving. Just enough butter to be melt in your mouth and even though I left off the additional sugar coating it was sweet enough to do the job. Thank you for the simple recipe!

I did a 1/2 of this recipe as I was really juat wanting a cookie lol. 
I used unsalted butter and added 1/4 tsp of salt and I am moving and my vanilla is at the other place so I used the same amount of maple syrup in its place.
These taste great!! They are not overly sweet like most sugar cookies. The buttery flavor comes through nicely! Mine dont look plump and adorable like yours but thats okay ;). 
These are going into my favorites book! Thanks

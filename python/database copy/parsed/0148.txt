Sweet Treats
Salted Rye Brownie
British grains are having a bit of a moment, and this recipe uses a rye flour. Elsewhere, a high-quality chocolate, with a decent level of acidity and bitterness, gives the cake an almost savoury edge and cacao nibs add a bit of crunch – but you can always use nuts instead. To really enhance the flavour, try some smoked sea salt sprinkled on top.

Serves
15-20 slices 
Total Time
45 Minutes 
Ingredients
550g of good dark chocolate 
200g of butter 
200g of rye flour 
4g of baking powder 
2g of fine sea salt 
6 eggs 
350g of soft light brown sugar 
40g of raw cacao nibs 
5g of sea salt flakes (smoked is a fun addition) 
Method
Step 1 
Preheat the oven to 180°C/160°C Fan.
Step 2 
Melt the chocolate, butter in a bowl over a saucepan of simmering water. Be careful the bowl doesn’t get too hot by removing from the heat if necessary. Once melted leave to cool a little.
Step 3 
Beat the eggs with an electric whisk for about 6 minutes adding the sugar a little at a time. The egg and sugar mixture should become frothy.
Step 4 
Slowly pour in the melted chocolate and butter mixture so it all become emulsified. Then add the rye, baking powder and fine sea salt and mix until it all combines.
Step 5 
Weigh out the mixture into a lined baking tray. Sprinkle with the cocoa nibs. Place in the oven for 30 minutes until the brownies puff up, but still wobbly. Allow to cool, and sprinkle with flaked sea salt.

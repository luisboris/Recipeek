1\. To make the potatoes: Preheat the oven to 375F. Line 1-2 rimmed baking sheet with parchment or a reusable silicone baking mat. Add oil to a large bowl and dried potato chunks. Stir to combine. Add salt and pepper to taste. Stirring to evenly coat. Place potatoes over 1-2 large baking sheet, taking care not to overcrowd and keep in a single layer. Bake for 35 minutes, or until golden and cooked through. Remove from oven and allow to cool.
2\. Meanwhile chop your dill and place in a large container.
3\. Make your dressing by combining the lemon juice, oil, water, tahini, mustard, garlic and salt in a small bowl/mug. Whisk/shake until smooth.
4\. To make your salad, combine the dill with the cooked potatoes and douse with about half of the dressing. Add more later if you wish.
I served this warm but leftovers were delicious cold as well.
Serves 6, with dressing to spare.

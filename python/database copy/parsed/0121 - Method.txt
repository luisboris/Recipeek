Method
Melt the butter in a small saucepan over low-medium heat. Once the butter has melted, add the milk and honey to the pot and remove from the heat.
Place the starter into a large mixing bowl, and add the milk mixture. Stir to combine.
Add the flour and salt to the bowl and mix into a shaggy dough. Set aside for 20 minutes.
Once the dough has rested, do three rounds of stretches and folds, once every 20 minutes over the course of an hour.
Once the folds are completed, cover the dough with a plate or damp tea towel. Set the bowl in a cool place (or refrigerate if preferred, see notes) overnight, or for about 12 hours.
After 12 hours, the dough should be doubled in size. Lightly flour a work surface and place the dough onto it.
Gently press the dough into a rough oval, about 2cm (¾ inch) thick. Use a cookie cutter or glass to cut the dough into rounds. Pictured are 8cm (3 inches) in diameter, but slightly larger or smaller are fine.
Place the rounds onto a parchment lined baking sheet. Press the remaining dough scraps together and repeat until all of the dough has been used.
Cover the rounds with a damp tea towel and set aside to rise again at room temperature for about 2 hours. After this time, the muffins should have risen slightly but not doubled in size.
Once the muffins have proved, heat a frying pan over medium heat. Once the pan is hot, carefully remove an English muffin from the tray and place it into the dry pan. Don’t add oil. Don’t worry if it deflates slightly when moved, it’ll puff up again. 
Cook for 4-5 minutes on one side, then flip and cook another 2-3 minutes on the second side. The muffins should about double in height and are ready when both sides are golden brown. Repeat until all of the muffins are cooked.
Cool fully before slicing and toasting. The English muffins freeze well for up to a month in an airtight container, and keep at room temperature for about 5 days.

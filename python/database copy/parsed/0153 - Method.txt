Instructions
Preheat oven to 350 degrees and line a sheet pan with parchment paper.
Combine all three kinds of cheese and half a tablespoon of seasoning in a bowl and mix well.
Using a teaspoon-sized amount, place each amount on the parchment-lined pan, keeping 1-2 inches between each chip. You will either need to do two sheet pans or two orders.
Bake for 7-11 minutes, depending on the oven and how dark you want them.
Upon removing from the oven, sprinkle with remaining seasoning.
Let the keto chips sit on the sheet pan for 5-10 minutes to harden, and then transfer to another dish to cool completely.

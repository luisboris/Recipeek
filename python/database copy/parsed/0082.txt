One Pan Chicken and Potatoes_ recipe is a simple, easy and delicious dinner idea that can be thrown together in minutes. Just toss chicken thighs, potatoes and carrots in the baking dish with seasoning & bake! _ 
Chicken thighs are not the only meat you can make this one pan chicken and potato bake with. Use Chicken Drumsticks and Potatoes if that is what you have and it will be just as good.
With this recipe there are no dishes to wash and the baked chicken thighs are juicy and crispy. Garlic makes the chicken and potatoes very fragrant and delicious! Don’t be afraid that it’s too much garlic. The cloves are not crushed, so they add just enough flavor without being overpowering.
People kept asking me if you can use chicken thighs to make the One Pan Meal {Drumsticks & Potatoes}, so I decided to make it with chicken thighs and show you that it works just as wonderful. This time I added a whole lot of garlic & one chopped up onion because I later made gravy with the drippings leftover from the chicken. Should l tell you that it was aah-mazing?!
Following this recipe, you’ll get very crispy chicken thighs, with crackly skin. The baked potatoes and carrots absorb the juices from the baked chicken thighs and create the most amazing meal ever!
Can I make this with Chicken Breast?
Yes! Just bake the potatoes for about 40 minutes before adding the chicken breast. Cook the chicken until the internal temperature registers at 160F.
Can I Make this with Sweet Potatoes?
Yes! Just make sure to bake the chicken for about 30 minutes before adding the sweet potatoes, as they tend to cook quicker.
What should I bake the One Pan Chicken and Potatoes in?
Using a large rimmed baking sheet for this recipe is the best if you would like your chicken and vegetables to crisp up well. The air has enough room to circulate therefore this would work great. 
If you use a glass baking dish or a deep baking sheet, this would prevent the chicken and potatoes from browning. So this would be ok to use, but not the best.
Can I use other vegetables with the chicken and potato bake?
Yes. If using zucchini, asparagus or other quick roasting vegetable and add them the last 20 minutes of baking time. Frozen peas are also fine. I would add them the last 5 minutes of baking.
Can I use different seasoning for this Baked Chicken and Potatoes Recipe?
You sure can! You can add dry ranch seasoning (with no salt), or rosemary, or thyme, or whatever else you like and then bake chicken and potatoes as the rest of the recipe states. You’re the boss, you decide 😉
Bon Appetite!

I made the one pan chicken thigh/potato recipe and wondered if the “375 for 1 hour and 20 minutes” was a typo but followed it. The thighs were so dry and over cooked they were almost inedible. Do you need to adjust the instructions?

Question about the recipe- it says in step 1 “baking sheet”, then step 4 “baking dish”, and step 7 “baking pan.” Where I live these are 3 separate things (I googled to make sure) but was hoping you could clarify!

Marina | Let the Baking Begin
It’s basically any baking dish/pan that will fit the ingredients and have a bit of a lip to prevent the juices from spilling. Anything that will do the job, will work. Using a larger baking pan so that there’s plenty of space around each piece will ensure the crispiness of the potatoes and the chicken. Using something smaller will prevent crisping and browning.

This was so easy and came out just like the picture and delicious. However, the grease was way too much. And I do love thighs as they are so much moister and more tender, so next time I’ll try thighs without the skin. Perhaps that will reduce the fat content?

I absolutely love how simple and delicious this recipe is. I’ve added onion powder and chicken bouillon powder to give it a richer flavor from time to time. Fun story, this was the first dish I made my s.o. To this day he doesn’t know if he’s more impressed with my cooking or the way I eat chicken lol needless to say, it’s been over 2.5 years since that meal. So many happy memories with this dish.

Hi Leslie, 
The 15-20 whole garlic cloves are added to in with the potatoes (whole), but the 4 tsp are added in as seasoning to coat and toss the potatoes and the chicken in.

My picky family allllll loved this, gave me a thumbs up and told me I’m allowed to make it again. Followed recipe exactly except that I tossed it all together in a bowl and then put it on the lined baking sheet. I used baby carrots and they got shriveled a bit so I would add them towards the end of cooking next time. Mine was done in 1 hour. Make sure you keep the skin on the chicken, it’s the best part. All the fat seeped into the potatoes and mmm mmm good! It’s in my rotation now- making it this week with drumsticks. Delicious. Thank you!!

I like this recipe but did cut the cooking time to about an hour, which made for a perfect result. 
Since no weights of meat are given, Perhaps mine were smaller than yours. I do prefer recipes that have that kind of information, but this tasted great .

Hi Doris, 
Here’s what it says in the post – 
Can I make this with Chicken Breast? 
Yes! Just bake the potatoes for about 40 minutes before adding the chicken breast. Cook the chicken until the internal temperature registers at 160F.”
If you’re going to use drumsticks, then just follow the recipe as written. THey cook in about the same amount of time as the chicken thighs.

Use this often and it has become my favorite. I live alone and can’t keep fresh potatoes and carrots on hand often, but guess what? Your recipe works with canned carrots and canned sliced potatoes! The veggies are a little crinkly and crunchy, but I like them like that and they still taste yummy. Thanks for the recipe. 🙂

I put all cut up carrots and potatoes, onions, garlic , spices and chicken in a big bowl and mixed with plastic gloves by hand, and then placed everything on the parchment lined baking sheet, while the oven heated to 375 degrees. An hour and 20 minutes went by, and I let everything cook for another 10 minutes, and perfection! Will use this recipe often, so delicious! And the chicken thighs were perfect! Cooked all the way through! No redness at all! Thank you for a great recipe!

Did everything to the T. The plate and even coming out of the oven looks super good…. flavor not so much… doesn’t have any… i choose to put a bit more than the recommended amount of spices ( i love spices) couldn’t taste any of them… 
all of it was plain. Marina any thoughts… ? Anything i should do differently?

Marina | Let the Baking Begin
Hi Alon, 
I’m sorry it didn’t come out as flavorful as you’d like. The blend and the amounts of spices are adjusted to my taste, but if there’s a seasoning mix you like better you can easily adjust the recipe by using it instead of the one I give in the recipe, or just increase the amount of spices until it is at the desired level. Some cultures use more spices than others and for those that do, the typical amount in the American recipes might seem bland. Not sure if that’s the case here, but do feel free to double or triple the amount or the kind of spices used in this recipe.

Stopped the oven at 1 hour. Everything was good but hard on the outside. Overcooked! And the parchment paper was cooked too!

Hi Dorothy, 
The recipe instructions say to use a baking sheet pan which is 12 inches by 16 inches. A cookie sheet is a different size. The ingredients listed in the recipe fit just fine in the baking sheet, just like you see on the pictures. The reason your chicken was tough on the outside was that it had more space for the heated air to circulate around thus speeding up the cooking time, drying them out more and faster.

This has all the great components but if want want dry chicken that can bounce of walls don’t cook for so long. Chicken thighs can cook I like 20-30 minutes. This timing is way off. I would add the chicken the last 30 minutes of cooking

My intention was not to be rude at all, I’m sorry if it came off that way. When I post recipes I test them numerous times before sharing and I’m always confused why when people get a different result than what my pictures (of food made following the same exact recipe) show, they think it’s the recipe’s fault. 
I’m always here to help troubleshoot if something went wrong and someone needs advice on how to make it right, because we live in different environments, with different kitchen equipment. But, I understand that sometimes you just want to get your frustration out regardless of what the reason for the failure is. It’s alright, too.

I make this bi-weekly. It is perfect. Delish, easy, and comforting. I make one change just because its what I have. I put olive oil and lots of Trader Joe’s 21 Seasoning Salute into a small bowl and brush the mixture onto the chicken, over and under the skin, with a silicone pastry brush. It makes the skin crispy and allows the chicken to really get flavorful.

I’ve made this three times now. Every single time, I have used my Instant Pot electric pressure cooker and then put it on a parchment covered sheet pan to broil for 5 minutes. I made it the first time as a last minute dinner for a friend and they loved it. We had it again for dinner tonight as today was super hectic and it was fantastic! I normally do not care for thighs, but they are great in this recipe. My son made a quick antipasto while it cooked.

I have a question and it made be a dump question but iam going to ask any way . Because if I was confused iam sure other inexperienced home coos are confused as well. I saw recipe for whole chicken 3 pounds. Use celery and margarine, onion power , salt and pepper. I went to store buy ingredients for recipe. Had two whole young chicken for ten dollars and thirty cents and one roasting chicken for six to seven dollars. My question is there difference between roasting chicken and whole chicken. I went with two whole yonge chicken for ten dollars. Because recipe say it need be a whole chicken.Did I make a mistake. Please help.

I am not sure what the correct answer to your question is. May be someone who has a recipe for that type of chicken would be best to answer that question? For this recipe you would need to use chicken thighs, which are the same kind everywhere 🙂

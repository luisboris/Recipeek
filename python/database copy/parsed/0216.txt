Sourdough Empanadas
Paul Stephen / Staff
This light and flaky pastry can be stuffed with picadillo, chicken tinga or other fillings for fluffy and delicate empanadas. It also makes a great pie crust.
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
2/3 cup cake flour
1 teaspoon salt
1 tablespoon granulated sugar
1/2 cup vegetable shortening, cold
1/2 cup butter, very cold and sliced into 1/4-inch thin slices
1 cup sourdough starter discard
2 cups cooked picadillo, chicken tinga, fruit or other empanada filling
1 egg, beaten
Instructions: Combine the all-purpose and cake flour with the salt and sugar. Whisk together to mix the ingredients evenly.
Using your fingers, cut the shortening into the flour mixture until it resembles coarse corn meal. Using your fingers, toss the butter into the flour mixture. Allow the slices of butter to break up into slightly smaller pieces into the flour. Work quickly so the butter doesn’t get warm. Don’t break the butter down completely. There should be some large flakes remaining.
Pour the sourdough discard onto the flour all at once and toss to combine. Gently press the dough just until it comes together. It will look a little dry in spots. The moisture will redistribute in the dough as it rests.
Wrap the dough and refrigerate for at least 2-3 hours before using.
Divide the dough into 4 portions. Roll the dough into circles about 1/4-inch thick. Place the filling in the center of the circles and moisten the edge of the dough with a bit of water. Fold the dough over the filling and crimp it closed with a fork.
Transfer the empanadas to a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Brush the surface of each with the egg. Bake at 400 degrees until the empanadas are nicely browned, 35-40 minutes, and serve hot.

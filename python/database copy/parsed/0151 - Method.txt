Preparation
1. Wash the 200 grams rice and place in a large saucepan along with the 250 millilitres water and Â½ teaspoon salt.
2. Turn the heat up and allow the rice to simmer for 20 minutes. Keep the lid on.
3. Pour the 750 millilitres milk into the saucepan. Allow to simmer for 40 minutes with the lid on at the lowest setting.
4. Add 2 handful raisins if you prefer and cook for a couple of minutes.
5. Some, like me like more hot milk as opposed to serving the pudding very thick with cold milk. Add 250 millilitres milk if you like warm milk and allow to simmer for 5 minutes.
6. Mix together 1 teaspoon rapadura sugar and 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon. Serve in a separate bowl.

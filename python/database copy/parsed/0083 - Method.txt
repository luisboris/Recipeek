Method:
1\. Dissolve the yeast and the sugar in a cup of warm water until the mixture is frothy. 
2\. Mix the flour and the salt in a large bowl and add the melted butter. 
3\. Add the yeast mixture and mix well. 
4\. Add the warm water as you go along to ensure a doughy consistency. When done, the dough should not be sticky. 
5\. Knead the dough on a bench top. Then place in a large bowl, cover it and leave the dough to rest for an hour or so. 
6\. Knead the dough again and cut it in small portions. 
7\. Roll out the portions as thinly as possible (you can use a pasta machine) and with a scone cutter or a glass cut the pastry in small circles. 
8\. Place the individual circles on a lightly dusted oven tray and bake until they are golden brown.

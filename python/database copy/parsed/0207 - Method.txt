Instructions
Slice cucumber very thin. Use a mandoline slicer for best results.
Remove excess moisture from slices using a paper towel.
Put cucumber slices in a large bowl and toss with oil, vinegar, and salt.
For dehydrator: Place slices on trays and dry at 125-135°F for 10-12 hours or until crispy.
For oven: Place slices on parchment lined baking tray. Dry at 175°F for 3-4 hours or until crispy.
Allow slices to cool before serving.
Notes
If using foil lined pans, don't cut the cucumbers too thin and be sure to flip half-way so they can be removed easier.
To remove excess moisture, you just need to use a paper towel to blot them dry. Another way to get the water out of them is to sprinkle them with salt and then set them on a colander. The salt will dry them out and the water will drip out of them.
Store them just like you would potato chips. Keep them in a sealed container at room temperature. There is no need to refrigerate them.

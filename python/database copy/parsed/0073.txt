Creamy Lemon-Dill Roasted Potato Salad
In Favourites, Salads on July 18, 2015 at 7:26 AM
This may very well turn out to be the summer of potatoes and mushrooms. While not everyone likes the mayo-heavy potato salads, everyone seems to like the non-mayo salads from this summer so far.
Rob said this was his favourite potato salad yet.
His Polish roots may be particularly partial to fresh dill.
The dressing is a creamy, but not heavy, lemon-tahini sauce with a touch of mustard which I tossed with salt-and-pepper roasted potatoes and fresh dill. The recipe makes a lot of dressing, which was great throughout the week to dress up some of the leftover grilled vegetables. The dressing was also great when I added in some extra chickpeas.
What is your favourite recipe for potato salad?
I am sharing this with Bookmarked Recipes and Tea Time Treats.
Creamy Lemon-Dill Roasted Potato Salad 
Adapted fromJoyous Health via Steven and Chris_
2 lbs small potatoes, halved, soaked in water, drained and patted dry 
1-2 tbsp melted coconut oil 
salt and pepper, to taste (I used lemon pepper seasoning)
1/4 cup chopped fresh dill
1/4 cup lemon juice (from 1 large lemon) 
1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil 
3 tbsp water 
2 tbsp tahini 
1 tbsp Dijon mustard 
1 clove garlic, pressed or minced 
1/4 tsp salt
1\. To make the potatoes: Preheat the oven to 375F. Line 1-2 rimmed baking sheet with parchment or a reusable silicone baking mat. Add oil to a large bowl and dried potato chunks. Stir to combine. Add salt and pepper to taste. Stirring to evenly coat. Place potatoes over 1-2 large baking sheet, taking care not to overcrowd and keep in a single layer. Bake for 35 minutes, or until golden and cooked through. Remove from oven and allow to cool.
2\. Meanwhile chop your dill and place in a large container.
3\. Make your dressing by combining the lemon juice, oil, water, tahini, mustard, garlic and salt in a small bowl/mug. Whisk/shake until smooth.
4\. To make your salad, combine the dill with the cooked potatoes and douse with about half of the dressing. Add more later if you wish.
I served this warm but leftovers were delicious cold as well.
Serves 6, with dressing to spare.

2. Oh man, this potato salad looks so good. SO good. I heart all kinds of potato salad, but I think the most frequent one I make is potato and green bean in a homemade dijon vinaigrette. Fresh oregano is great too. Hooray for potato salad!

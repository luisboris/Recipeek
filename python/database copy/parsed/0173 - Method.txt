Directions: 
1\. Soak the short grain rice in water (the 11/2 liters) overnight, donâ€™t discard the water, you will be using it to cook the rice later. 
2\. Transfer the soaked rice with the water to a large pot. Add the turmeric powder and place on high heat. Once the water boils reduce heat to very low, cover the pot and preferably use a heat diffuser underneath the pot. Leave it for about 40 minutes until the rice is cooked to a fully sticky mushy texture. Set aside to cool down a bit. 
3\. Stir the tahini jar well with a fork to homogenize. 
4\. Add the sugar and tahini to the rice and (now the labor intensive starts) and cook uncovered over medium heat. You will have to stir the mixture all the time with a wooden spoon (a small suggestion, call your friends and neighbors to help and take turn in stirring). Cook and for about 2 hours or until the oil of the tahini starts to separate from the mixture (In Arabic we call it sarej) It is an indication that the moufataka is ready. 
5\. Add the pine nuts, give a quick stir. Transfer the moufataka to individual plates. Serve warm or cold! How yummy!!

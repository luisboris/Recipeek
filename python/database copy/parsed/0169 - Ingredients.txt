Ingredients
1 lb dry chickpeas (also known as garbanzo beans) \- you must start with dry, do NOT substitute canned, they will not work!
1/2 tsp baking soda
1 small onion, roughly chopped
1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley
3-5 cloves garlic (I prefer roasted garlic cloves)
1 1/2 tbsp flour or chickpea flour
1 3/4 tsp salt
2 tsp cumin
1 tsp ground coriander
1/4 tsp black pepper
1/4 tsp cayenne pepper
Pinch of ground cardamom
1 tsp baking powder (optional - makes the falafel more fluffy)
Vegetable oil for frying \- grapeseed, sunflower, avocado, canola, and peanut oils all work well

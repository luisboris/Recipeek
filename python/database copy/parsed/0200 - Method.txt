Tip:
Despite this, baked potatoes and green beans are among our favorite side dishes. For this recipe, the sauce is so fantastic and makes it much tastier. Brown rice and steamed broccoli are other ideas. They are so fast and so tasty. Keep it, and serve a simple side dish to make a quick dinner. Our family loves just one of these I always make use of what I already have or can find on offer.

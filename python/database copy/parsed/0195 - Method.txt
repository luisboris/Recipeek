Instructions
Combine the honey, soy sauce, ketchup, garlic, and chili paste in a small bowl or glass measuring cup. Stir to combine.
Place the meatballs in the slow cooker. Pour the sauce over the meatballs and stir to coat thoroughly. Cover with lid and cook on LOW for 4 hours or HIGH for 1½ hours.
Stir well, taking care to scrape the sides of the crock-pot. Add the bell peppers and stir again to mix throughout. Cover with lid and cook on HIGH for 1 more hour. Stir and serve warm OR reduce heat to WARM and hold for up to 2 more hours.
Notes
My choice for this recipe is miniature or bite-size (approximately 1-inch) frozen meatballs whenever possible. I’ve used “party” meatballs, homestyle meatballs, even Italian meatballs without any issues. I typically use whichever meatballs are in my freezer.
If you’re leery of the chili paste, use the lesser amount or feel free to skip it entirely. It works both ways.

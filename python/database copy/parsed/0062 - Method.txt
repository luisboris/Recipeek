Instructions
Wash and peel the ears of corn without tearing their leaves. Cut strips about ¼ inch (0.5 cm) wide along the length of a few corn husks that will serve as ties for the humitas. Keep the rest whole. Set aside.
Remove the corn from the cob using a grater or a sharp knife.
Heat the oil and butter in a skillet over medium heat.
Fry the onion for 1 minute, then add red pepper and garlic, and sauté until the onion is translucent.
Add the tomatoes, paprika, oregano, cinnamon, salt and white pepper, and mix well.
Fry for 15 minutes, stirring regularly.
Remove from the heat, and add the corn, milk, cheese and sugar, and mix well.
Place 2 corn leaves crosswise onto a work surface.
Place 2 tablespoons of corn stuffing in the center.
Wrap the contents as if they were bundles, and tie them with the corn strips cut for this purpose.
Heat a large amount of salted water in a pot and add the 2 bay leaves.
Place the humitas into the water, and boil for 30 minutes.
Serve hot.

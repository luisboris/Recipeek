Ingredients
4 1/2 oz (125 g) 80%+ dark chocolate, chopped (you can use chocolate with a lower cocoa solids percentage â€“ in this case, you will need to reduce the amount of coconut sugar)
1/4 cup (50 g) coconut oil, softened at room temperature (but not melted)
3 medium eggs, room temperature
3/4 - 1 1/4 cups (100 - 175 g) coconut sugar (less if you're using chocolate with a lower cocoa solids percentage)
1 cup (90 g) almond flour
1/4 cup (30 g) cocoa powder
pinch of salt
1/2 - 1 cup dark chocolate chunks and chips (optional)

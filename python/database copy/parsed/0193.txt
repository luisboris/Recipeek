Ingredients for making pasta soup
This orzo pasta soup is loaded with veggies so you need a lot of veggies, you can use ones you have at hand but not limited to celery, carrots, spinach, corn kernels, onions, and green onions.
Also, you can use pasta of your choice instead of orzo. Tomato basil sauce can be substituted by tomato sauce or diced tomatoes. 
Herbs like thyme, oregano, and rosemary, dried or fresh, add a great flavor to the soup. If you don't have them, you can skip them. 
Since this is a vegan soup, I am using vegetable stock. Add some salt and pepper to your taste.
You will also need some olive oil, bay leaf, and garlic for sauteing. 
How to make vegetable soup with pasta in instant pot?
Vegetable pasta soup is one of the easiest recipes to make in the instant pot. First, turn the instant pot on saute mode on the normal setting.
Once hot, add some olive oil followed by bay leaf and garlic. Add the onions and continue to saute for about 30 seconds.
Add the other vegetables except for spinach and green onions. Add the tomato basil sauce, pasta, herbs, salt, pepper, and vegetable stock. Mix well and deglaze the bottom of the pot with a spatula.
Come out of the saute mode by pressing the cancel button. Close and lock the lid with valve in sealing position and "keep warm" setting on.
Start the high pressure or manual mode for 0, yes zero, minutes. Once done, let the pressure lease naturally for 6 minutes and then release the remaining pressure. 
Stir in the spinach and onion greens. Adjust salt, pepper, and herbs to taste.
Serving and storing suggestions
Vegetable pasta soup is best when served hot and enjoy this comforting hearty soup for lunch or dinner.
You can refrigerate any leftovers for 2-3 days.

Hi, I don't have an instant pot. Can I prepare this soup on the stove ?

Hi Angie,
Yes, you can prepare this on the stove by cooking all the ingredients on the stove except orzo until they are tender. You may have to add more liquid as it will evaporate while boiling. On the side, you can cook orzo as per package instructions and then add it to the soup at the end.
Hope this helps.

Hi Maggs
Pasta soup does not freeze well as pasta tends to become soggy and not maintain its shape. If you want to freeze it, you can make soup without pasta and freeze it. Cook some pasta separately and add it when you are ready to eat it.
Hope this helps

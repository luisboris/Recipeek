No Knead Spelt Focaccia

Jump to Recipe Print Recipe
You will love this no knead spelt focaccia! It‚Äôs healthy, easy to make and delicious! It also uses very few ingredients. I topped mine with green olives, onions, swiss cheese and thyme. 
But as always, feel free to be inspired by my ingredients or you can make up your own. I love using red peppers, black olives, havarti cheese. Or make it a little more plain with just olive oil, coarse salt and rosemary.
As always, let‚Äôs go through the ingredients together!
Recipe and Baker‚Äôs Math ‚Äì No Knead Spelt Focaccia
Ingredient| Baker‚Äôs %| Grams for 2 focaccias 
Bread Flour| 75%| 750 
Whole Wheat| 25%| 250 
Water| 73%| 730 
Salt| 2%| 20 
Levain| 20%| 200 
Total Dough| 195%| 1,950 
If I don‚Äôt have a sourdough starter can I make this no knead spelt focaccia?
Unfortunately no! as you can‚Äôt just substitute a sourdough starter for commercial yeast in a recipe.
But, if you are interested in having one, check out my online sourdough class here. I teach it once a month and I will get you started in this sourdough bread journey. We create your starter and make your 1st loaf together! It‚Äôs a flexible class and very personalized.
Do you know the health benefits of bread using a sourdough starter?
Baking with a sourdough starter is the most healthy way to make bread as it breaks down the gluten, the sugars (low glycemic index food) and it also makes the grains nutrition available for us to absorb it. So, once you have your starter it‚Äôs a NO turning back point!
Do I have to use Bread Flour to make this No Knead Spelt Focaccia?
No, you can also use All Purpose Flour. As we are working with a sourdough starter make sure you use good quality flours. I always recommend King Arthur. It‚Äôs easy to find and you will make sure you succeed.
Where can I find whole grain spelt flour to make this no knead spelt focaccia?
I buy local fresh milled flours from one of the mills we have close to the studio in Pennsylvania. Here is the link of their store they have an amazing variety of grain and flours!
What does _Levain_ mean in the recipe?
It means your ripe sourdough starter! 
Which means that it should at least be doubled in size before you plan to mix the dough.
What ratios should you feed your sourdough starter for this no knead spelt focaccia recipe?
I always follow a 10x: 100x: 100x ratio of starter, flour and water. So, 12 hours approximately before you plan to mix your dough mix the below grams in a container.
15 grams of starter
150 grams of all purpose or bread flour
150 grams of water
After its thoroughly mixed, leave in a warm spot until it doubles.

Enjoy this healthy and easy to make focaccia as an appetizer with your favorite toppings!

Prep Time 5 hrs
Cook Time 1 d 40 mins
Course Appetizer
Equipment
Bowl
Scraper
Digital Scale
Baking pan size 13 x 9 inches (approx)
Knife to chop vegetables
Ingredients
750 grams Bread Flour King Arthur
250 grams Spelt Flour Castle Valley Mill
730 grams Water Room temp
20 grams Salt Fine
200 grams Leaven
Olive Oil to grease the pan
Instructions
12 hours before you plan to mix this dough feed your sourdough starter according to the instructions provided above
Once your starter is ripe, which means doubled in size, measure out all the ingredients in separate containers
In a bowl mix: flours, water, leaven, salt. Mix until there are no lumps and all the flour has been incorporated
Perform folds every 30 minutes for the next 3-4 hours (depending in your dough's temperature)
Cover and let the dough sit in the refrigerator for the next 12 to 36 hours.
Bring the dough out of the refrigerator, divide in half. Place the other half back in the refrigerator covered.
Grease your baking pan with olive oil and place one of the doughs inside. Stretch it out until it covers the pan in about 80%. If it fights you back during the process, let it rest and extend as it slowly.
Cover the baking pan and let it rise again. For the 1 or 2 more hours (depending on your doughs temperature)
Preheat your oven to 450¬∞F
Dimple the focaccia and add olive oil on top. At this moment add the vegetables of your choice. For the one you see on the photo I added: thyme, swiss cheese, onions, green olives.
Bake for 35-40 min. It's ready when the bottom of the focaccia is gold and crispy.
Enjoy! 
Repeat the same process with your 2nd half of dough.

Instructions
1. Gather your spices.
2. Optional: Toast your whole spices in a dry skillet for a few minutes until fragrant. Be careful not to burn them! Once their aroma is released, remove it from heat and let cool completely.
3. Combine spices in a spice grinder, coffee grinder, or mortar and pestle. You can also use your Mockmill! (See instructions below.)
4. Grind until they are a fine powder.
5. Transfer to a small, air-tight container. If desired, use a fine-mesh strainer to filter out any larger particles.
6. Store your Chinese five-spice powder in a cool, dark location. Use up within a matter of months for the best flavor.
I do recommend whole spices, but if any of your spices are ground, go ahead with grinding the whole ones and simply mix in the ground spices after the fact.

This simple 5 ingredient recipe makes The Best Baked Chicken Legs I have ever had in my whole life! (And the masses agree – this recipe has been shared more than 250,000 times!) Just pop these legs in the oven, and you’ll have a crispy chicken dinner!
I’m no stranger to excellent baked chicken legs. Try these:Sweet and Spicy Baked Chicken Legs, Lemon Garlic Baked Chicken Legs and 4-Ingredient Honey Mustard Baked Chicken Legs.
Oven Baked Chicken Legs With Honey
Not only is this one of my kids’ favorite ways to enjoy chicken, but this recipe is also on its way to breaking the internet! For real. I knew it was delicious and easy, but after being shared more than 250,000 times with oodles of reviews from people who’ve made them (check ‘em out in the comments section), I almost can’t believe how much you guys are in love with this recipe!
I think what really knocks this recipe out of the park is the fact that chicken legs are so inexpensive and pack such incredible flavor, and the rest of the ingredients needed for this dish are probably ones you already have in your fridge and pantry. Score! They’re a little bit sweet and a little bit salty, with just a hint of garlic on that sticky exterior. I mean… What’s not to love?
Chicken with Soy Sauce Marinade
The sauce is truly addicting. You’ll want it on fried rice, steamed veggies, and maybe even in a cup with a straw to drink it — it’s THAT good. I’d love to know if you give this recipe a try and love feedback, so leave a comment if you give these a go!
Tips and Tricks for Making the BEST Baked Chicken Legs
Here for the right pan: Because these guys are thick and saucy, you’ll want a sheet pan with high sides to keep all the juices in and large enough so the chicken isn’t drowning in the sauce. To get the best caramelized texture, the chicken should stick out of the sauce a bit while cooking. 
Foil it up: Make sure you carefully line the pan with foil so you avoid a sticky mess during cleanup. 
Sauce, sauce everywhere: This sauce is so good you may be tempted to bathe in it. Fair warning. I recommend serving the chicken legs with rice and steamed vegetables, and douse those well in the sauce, too. (Although I doubt it’ll take much convincing.) 
Check the temperature: To make sure the chicken is actually done, use this affordable instant read thermometer. Better safe than sorry! 
Slow cooker friendly: Hallelujah, this recipe IS slow cooker adaptable. I use a ½ cup of ketchup, honey, and soy sauce instead of the portions in the instructions, and it turns out a little less sticky, but just as flavorful and heavenly.

How Long Does It Take for Drumsticks to Cook in the Oven?
This really just depends on how you’re cooking it. I like to start with a preheated 350 degree F. oven and bake them for 45 minutes, rotate the legs, raise the heat to 425 degrees F., and put them back for about another 15 minutes, until the sauce is bubbly and everything looks caramelized. Turning the legs is key to getting the sauce on “top” of the chicken legs!
Is Chicken Drumstick Dark Meat?
Yep! The wings, thighs, and drumsticks are dark meat in chicken, and usually they have a much heartier, juicier flavor and more tender texture than white meat.
How to Cook Chicken Legs in a Slow Cooker
Place all of the chicken legs in the bottom of a slow cooker (I have this slow cooker). Pour the sauce over the chicken legs. Slow cook on low for 6 hours or on high for 4 hours, until the largest piece of chicken registers 165 degrees F. on an instant read thermometer.
This option is great for all the reasons the slow cooker is great. You can start it in the middle of the day and have dinner on the table without much hands-on work during the busy evening. Or you can get the slow cooker going, leave the house, and come home to dinner. This is great for working parents, for Sunday dinner (it can cook while you are at church), or if you are running kids to practices or lessons in the evening. This option leads to flavorful moist chicken, but the outside and skin don’t crisp at all.

The Best Baked Chicken Legs

Author: Melissa Griffiths - Bless this Mess
Prep Time: 5 min
Cook Time: 1 hour
Total Time: 1 hour 5 min
Yield: Serves 4 to 6 1x
Description
This simple 5 ingredient recipe makes The Best Baked Chicken Legs I have ever had in my whole life! (And the masses agree – this recipe has been shared more than 250,000 times!) Just pop these legs in the oven, and you’ll have a crispy chicken dinner!
Scale 1x2x3x
Ingredients
2 1/2 pounds chicken legs (about 10 legs)
3/4 cup honey
1/2 cup soy sauce
1/4 cup ketchup
2–3 cloves garlic, minced (or 1 heaping teaspoon of preminced garlic)
Instructions
1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Lay the chicken legs out in a foil-lined baking dish with high sides (the foil is to make clean up easier — it’s not essential but helps a whole lot). A high-sided sheet pan is the best option because it has sides to keep everything in, but it is big enough that the chicken isn’t drowning in the sauce. It will caramelize best if half of the chicken is poking out of the sauce while cooking.
2. In a glass measuring cup, measure out the honey, soy sauce, and ketchup. Add the minced garlic, and stir. If the mixture doesn’t combine well, microwave it on high for 30 seconds and stir again. Pour the honey mixture over the chicken legs.
3. Put the chicken legs in the oven and bake for 45 minutes. Take the chicken out of the oven, and rotate it so that the bottom that was in the sauce is now on top, out of the sauce.
4. Put the legs back in the oven. Raise the heat to 425 degrees F., and bake until the sauce is bubbly and starts to caramelize on the chicken legs. This should take about 15 minutes.
5. Remove the chicken from the oven, and allow to rest for 5 minutes before serving. Serve the sauce the the chicken cooked in with the meal or over rice if you’d like.
Notes
A pan slightly larger than 9×13 inch with sides is the best option because it has sides to keep all the juice in but is big enough that the chicken isn’t drowning in the sauce. It will caramelize best if half of the chicken is poking out of the sauce while cooking. My pan is 11×15 inches and it works best. If your pan is too large though your sauce will be too shallow, evaporate and burn.
Lining your pan with foil makes clean-up much easier. I recommend it.
The sauce that the chicken cooks in is delicious over cooked rice and steamed or roasted vegetables (like broccoli and cauliflower) to round out the meal.
I like to use a little meat thermometer to make sure the chicken is done – better safe than sorry!
This recipe is a LONG time favorite in our house and it is highly adaptable to the slow cooker (hooray!!!). I change the portions a bit (use a 1/2 cup of ketchup, honey, and soy sauce), but it still tastes great. It’s a little less sticky, but it’s simple and flavorful.

Wow, now I know why these are so popular! I had prepped the sauce and legs in a gallon storage bag last week. Before I could cook them we had to leave for an emergency, so I threw the bag in the freezer. I thawed them for last night’s dinner, and this is now our favorite recipe for chicken legs. I plan to keep a container of these ready in the freezer at all times. Thank you for a recipe that is delicious and affordable.

I made the best baked chicken legs recipe and WOW! My whole family gave it a thumbs up and I have picky eaters! The sauce is so tangy, I never dreamt that ketchup, honey, garlic and soy sauce would mesh together so well! I had one drumstick left over and I have to say, the sauce (which was delicious the first time around) was even tastier after sitting for a day! I can’t wait to try it again with rice or noodles. I’m so glad I printed this recipe and put it in my keeper notebook for future use. I think I will try dicing up some chicken thighs to bite size pieces to cook as the one complaint I got was how messy the drumsticks were. This recipe is definitely a keeper! Thank you so much for adding a new recipe to my boring dinner rotation!

How can I adjust the cooking time if I use chicken thighs instead? It’s all I have at the moment and chicken is something I’m always scared to cook improperly.

I’d add 20 minutes to the first baking time before you change the temperature!

This was fantastic. My picky husband said it was sooobgood and the chicken was so tender. I did what 1 reviewer said and marinated this for about an hour before baking. Next time I’ll try it in the slow cooker and am also gonna try the sauce with ribs.

So glad you liked it! I use the sauce for meatballs in the slow cooker a lot too, it’s really good for that!

The picture that you display there at the bottom has no sauce on the bottom and from what it looks like it has some sauce on the top probably set with a broiler. Just saying it looks a little pre staged and not done as the directions state. I cannot for the life of me see why people do these sorts of things. happens all the time. It makes a person that does not realize whats up feel like they did something wrong. LOL Is that the goal? 
try My recipe – Nope you are still a failure LOL. 
I do like the idea, it’s the same idea I have every time I make baked bbq legs, hot leggs. and so on. Tonight I do it your way. :o) It wont be staged though, they are in the oven right now. 
Did you know that if you slice up celery in 1/2 inch sections and toss them in the pan , pushing them down to keep the leggs apart a little that they cook more evenly? You dont have to use celery but it is tasty. You can use whatever you like to keep your legs apart.

I just pulled them out of the pan and put them on the serving platter… the sauce was still there and still used over rice. You for sure could add celery, I’d probably add it part way through cooking so that it doesn’t get too done.

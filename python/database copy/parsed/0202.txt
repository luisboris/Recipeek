Quick & Easy Stovetop Keto Zone Pizza Crust
21 Feb, 2019

There are literally hundreds if not thousands of cauliflower pizza crust recipes on the web.
They are not always easy. Many flop. Some require a lot of time, ingredients, and even a good sense of humor.
This is not one of them.
This Keto Zone Pizza Crust Recipe can be made in 15 minutes. It’s cooked on the stovetop in a skillet rather than baked. What’s more, it will keep you in the Keto Zone while you enjoy one of your favorite foods. And, if you still prefer buying a crust rather than making it, I have some suggestions for those as well.
Quick and Easy Stovetop Keto Zone Pizza Crust
Ingredients :
Keto Zone dough:_
1 cup almond flour
3 tablespoons coconut flour
2 teaspoons xanthan gum
1 teaspoon baking powder
1/4 teaspoon sea salt
2 teaspoons apple cider vinegar
1 high omega-3 egg, lightly beaten
5 teaspoons water as needed
Toppings:_
Keto Zone Marinara Sauce
mozzarella cheese
Meats such as natural sausage
Fresh herbs – oregano, basil, etc.
Instructions:
1. Place both flours, xanthan gum, baking powder and salt to food processor. Pulse until thoroughly combined (or combine well by hand in bowl).
2. Add vinegar while continuing to stir. Once mixed, pour in egg. Then, add water just until the dough begins to ball – it will be sticky but sturdy.
3. Wrap dough in plastic wrap. Then, knead it while wrapped 1-2 minutes. Dough should be smooth and not too cracked (small cracks are okay). If too cracked, add 1 teaspoon water and knead again.
4. Allow dough to rest for 10 minutes at room temperature. Or, save up to 5 days in refrigerator.
5. To cook stovetop: heat up a skillet or pan over medium/high heat while dough rests. Make sure pan is very hot by dropping a drop of water on it – it should sizzle.
6. Roll out dough between two sheets of parchment paper with a rolling pin. Get it as thin as possible and around 12 inches in diameter. Fold over edges by pressing with wet fingertips.
7. Cook the pizza crust in your pre-heated skillet. Cook on the first side for about 2 minutes or until blistered. Then, lower heat to medium/low. Flip over pizza crust, add toppings, cover pan with lid, and cook 2-3 minutes until all toppings are melted/cook and dough is cooked on the bottom.
8. Makes one crust with slices. Enjoy immediately.

Keto Zone Homemade vs. Commercial
This quick recipe makes it easy to have homemade Keto Zone pizza. But, sometimes, it can still be tough to get it done.
In these cases, there are some decent pizza crusts and mixes available.
3 Top-Rated Commercial Keto Pizza Crusts
When choosing a commercial Keto Pizza Crust or Mix:
First things first, turn the package over and always look at the ingredient list first. The front side of a package is little more than marketing. Look at every ingredient and avoid soybean oil, concentrated omega-6 oils, high fructose corn syrup, MSG, silicone dioxide (silica) and other preservatives), food colorings and chemical flavoring. Acceptable? Go to step 2. Unacceptable? Look for another.
Look at the nutrition label. Does it fit into Keto Zone Eating? What are the net carbs and amount of fat? Acceptable? Move to step 3. Unacceptable? Look for another.
Does it meet your standards for taste, texture, and convenience? When you’re buying keto foods, you’re usually spending a decent amount of money. Make sure it’s worth it based on reviews, recommendations, and instructions. If not, make your own with our Keto Zone Pizza Crust Recipe.
Here are 2 online options, both made with cauliflower, that pass the test (although most do still require a fork to eat, they are not “crisp”):
1. Cali’flour Foods Gluten Free, Low Carb Cauliflower Original Italian Pizza Crusts: This option can be bought online, but it is pricey at $24 for 2 crusts. However, it gets high ratings, has only a few whole-food ingredients (cauliflower, mozzarella cheese, eggs, basil, garlic), contains 3 gm net carbs per crust, and can be a big time-saver when needed.
2. Outer Aisle Gourmet – (8 crusts) Cauliflower Pizza Crusts – Low Carb, Gluten Free, Paleo Friendly, Keto – 4 Pack (8 Crusts) : This option is a bit more affordable at $28 for 8 personal pizza crusts, but is not quite as highly rated. It does only have 3 gm net carbs per crust and using simple whole food ingredients (Fresh Cauliflower, Eggs, Parmesan Cheese, Basil, Oregano, Garlic & Nutritional Yeast).
3. Look at your local health food grocer for other options and check the ingredients list!

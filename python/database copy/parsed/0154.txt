Low-Calorie Starbucks Pink Drink Swap Recipe 
Jul 1 2020
I LOVE your swap for the Starbucks Pink Drink and used to make it all the time! But then one of the main ingredients was discontinued: the strawberry açai green tea mix. Please tell me you have an alternative! 
Pretty Thirsty in Pink
Thanks for your email! I was so sad when Lipton stopped making that drink mix. But I recently got back in the kitchen to come up with a solution, and I found it in Crystal Light’s Wild Strawberry drink mix! Even though it doesn’t contain açai or green tea, those flavors aren’t that present in the original drink anyway. And the Crystal Light mix even has some caffeine! Without further ado, here’s my new & improved recipe. (Click on the links below to watch me make it!)

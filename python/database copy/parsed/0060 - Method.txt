Instructions
In a large bowl, combine all the ingredients and beat well. Add salt and pepper.
In an 8-inch (20 cm) nonstick pan, melt the butter or oil over medium heat. Pour the mixture and cook on medium-low heat for about 8 minutes.
Using a knife, gently cut the kuku into 4 wedges. Carefully turn each piece to brown the other side. If necessary, add a little butter or oil in the pan.
Mix the yogurt and garlic and serve kuku accompanied by the sauce.

Instructions
Heat 5 tablespoons of oil in a skillet over medium to high heat.
When the oil is hot, add the cumin and nigella seeds and cook for a few seconds until they pop, then add the potatoes and sauté until golden brown.
Remove the potatoes from the skillet using a skimmer and place them in a bowl.
Repeat the same operation with the cauliflower, and transfer them to a separate bowl.
Lower the heat to low to medium, add the remaining 2 tablespoons of oil, and the onion and sauté until tender and golden (but not brown), then stir in the garlic and ginger and sauté while stirring for a few minutes.
Add the tomatoes, ground coriander, chili and turmeric and cook, stirring regularly, until the oil begins to surface on the sides of the skillet.
Add the potatoes and green hot peppers. Season with salt. Bring to a boil, lower the heat, cover and cook for 5 minutes.
Add the cauliflower and water, mix, cover and cook until the cauliflower and potatoes are tender, gently stirring occasionally, to make sure they don't stick by adding more water gradually, if necessary.
Remove from the heat, stir in the kasuri methi and garam masala and let stand 10 minutes, then stir in the lime juice and cilantro before serving.
Serve with rice, naan or paratha bread.

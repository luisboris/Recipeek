lachha paratha recipe | lachha parantha recipe with step by step photo and video recipe. lachha paratha is a popular paratha recipe prepared in ease. it is very similar to kerala paratha however, taste different. there are many ways of preparing lachha parantha in india. however, i have showed, two simple way of creating perfect layers. lachha paratha doesn‚Äôt require more oil as of kerala parota.
initially, i use to believe that, lachha paratha and kerala paratha are same. however, they are completely different. i would say both are cousin parathas. the main difference is the flour, obliviously. while, in lachha paratha, we use 1:1 ratio of wheat and all purpose flour. where as, in malabar paratha, it is just plain flour with lot of oil. both the parathas are prepared with multi layers. perhaps it is the confusing part for most of them. also, laccha paratha is good for digestion compared to malabar paratha. because, the dough is prepared with just maida and is not good for digestion.
however, i personally like kerala paratha compared to lachha paratha. probably, because it is more flaky, crispy and fluffy. furthermore, it is also very popularly served in many restaurants in my home town. i still remember my college days lunch hour. my college canteen use to serve amazing parathas with either veg saagu or palak paneer. also, the sugar added in the dough would give nice caramelisation and beautiful colour. moreover, those flaky layers of paratha would trap good amount of curries in each dip.
finally, check my other collection of paratha recipes and collection of roti recipes. specifically, aloo cheese paratha , roomali roti , garlic naan and jowar bhakri recipe. also, do check my veg indian curries collection for the parathas. specifically, paneer kadai , malai kofta , aloo gobhi and dahi wali bhindi recipe.

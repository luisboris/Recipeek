This Creamy Vegan Polenta with Mushrooms, Spinach and Pine nuts makes an easy gluten-free lunch or dinner that is plant-based, healthy and ready in only 15 minutes. It‚Äôs also perfect as side dish and you can serve it with any vegetables you like._
My perfect simple weeknight meal is usually packed with vegetables and whole foods, that fills me up, and tastes delicious. I really LOVE pasta and risotto, but sometimes it even happens to me that I want to eat something different. Then this easy Creamy Vegan Polenta bowl comes just right! Honestly, I make it so often because it‚Äôs such a perfect meal that you can cook anytime with less effort! To make it even simpler, I prefer using finely ground polenta, which takes only 2 minutes to cook.
How to make a creamy dreamy and yummy Vegan Polenta
The first time I‚Äôve made polenta, it was somehow very boring. But after trying some different variations, I fell in love with this delicious dish! It‚Äôs so versatile because you can combine it with any veggies and flavors. Anyways, I like it best served with mushrooms, spinach, and toasted pine nuts. To make it super creamy I use coconut milk but you can also use any other plant-based milk of choice.
Vegan Polenta with Mushrooms and Spinach
I am probably the biggest fan of Mushrooms and Spinach. That‚Äôs why I love adding these vegetables to any kind of savory meals, such as Gnocchi, Pasta, Risotto, Dumplings, Empanadas and more. I also like to use them as topping for my beloved Avocado Toast or homemade Pizza. I mean, nothing‚Äòs better than loading your meal with veggies that are tasty, flavorful, and also healthy, right?
This Creamy Vegan Polenta is:
Gluten-free
Plant-based
Dairy-free
Easy to make
Super creamy
Flavorful
Absolutely delicious
Perfect as a main dish or side dish
Toasted Pine Nuts for an extra tasty flavor (or use options)
Pimp your meal with toasted pine puts! Trust me, they‚Äôll add such an amazing flavor! I totally love their nutty taste and would never omit them. If you‚Äôre allergic to nuts, don‚Äôt worry. You can use toasted seeds or grains, such as sunflower, pumpkin, sesame, buckwheat, etc. instead. Also, toasted gluten-free bread crumbs taste great as a topping.
Feel free to choose the ingredients you like. There are so many possibilities and ways how you can serve your Creamy Vegan Polenta. Just be creative!

Ingredients
Polenta (Basic Recipe):
1 cup polenta (150 g) (see recipe notes)
¬æ cup full-fat coconut milk (200 ml)
1 ¬º cup vegetable broth (300 ml)
2-3 tbsp nutritional yeast flakes or vegan parmesan cheese (optional)
Mushroom Spinach Topping:
1 tbsp olive oil or coconut oil
1 onion sliced
7 oz mushrooms (200 g) sliced
2 cloves garlic minced
1-2 tbsp soy sauce
2 cups spinach roughly chopped
salt, black pepper to taste
2-3 tbsp pine nuts (options see text above)
Instructions 
Note: Check out the recipe video for visual instruction!
Polenta:
Bring coconut milk and vegetable broth to a boil in a pot. Stir in polenta by using a whisk.
Reduce heat to a low simmer and continue to whisk for 1-2 minutes to avoid lumps.
Then cover and let simmer for about 10 minutes (or according packaging instructions), stirring occasionally. (If the polenta thickens too much you can add additional milk and/or water and stir to thin.)
Once the Polenta is creamy and smooth, remove from the stovetop. Add nutritional yeast or vegan parmesan and stir (optional).
Mushroom Spinach Topping:
Heat oil in a skillet or pan. Add mushrooms along with onions and fry for about 3 minutes on high heat or until beginning to get golden-brown.
Add minced garlic and roast for 30 seconds longer. Then add soy sauce and spinach and cook for 1-2 minutes or until spinach is wilted. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Add a splash of fresh lime juice, if you like.
Toast pine nuts in a small pan without oil until lightly browned.
Serve polenta with mushrooms, spinach and pine nuts.
Enjoy!
Notes
To make it even simpler and creamier, I prefer using finely ground polenta, that takes only 2 minutes to cook. If using regular yellow corn grits please read the cooking time stated on the package. Otherwise you could also use cornmeal.
Instead of coconut milk you can add any plant-based milk. Add 1 tbsp vegan butter, if using low-fat milk.

Nice recipe and really good combination of ingredients. 
Two questions about website/post: 8-9 photos of the completed dish and none of the process along the way? Was looking to see what size to chop the onion, for example, but not a single photo of the prep process? Maybe I missed something? 
Comments section allllllllll the way at the endddddd of the loooooong string of comments. Almost couldn‚Äôt find it? 
Thank you! Elizabeth

Loved this easy to make vegan dinner. Added a red leaf lettuce tossed salad and dinner was ready in no time. 
I have a soy allergy so used Naked Coconut soy free soy sauce substitute. It worked out well. Loved the nutritional yeast added to polenta and on top of salad for added Protein. 
Will definitely make again üëç

I am really not a mushroom fan so this recipe was a risk for me, but oh man did it pay off! I can‚Äôt believe I‚Äôd never thought to make polenta with coconut milk before, but the end result was absolutely delicious, especially next to the soy sauce-y vegetables. Plus the whole recipe comes together super quickly and easily. This one is definitely entering my rotation!

Polenta in my country is called sadza or pap. We make it so that it‚Äôs solid enough to hold as a ball in your hands. I like experimenting with it as well. Maybe one day you might try the version you can eat with your hands.

OMG, you are amazing! I was so excited to stumble upon your blog that I spent three hours reading and copying your recipes to my tablet and then, of course, subscribed. I‚Äôve been a vegetarian for over 30 years and am always looking for new foods to try and inspiring ways to prepare them. I‚Äôm retired and spend a significant amount of time reading vegetarian and vegan blogs, and I have never been so Inspired!!! I know I‚Äôll be having lots of fun and inventive yummy meals for months. I counted how many recipes I copied so far that I feel I must try, and I came up with 48! I started with this polenta dish because I had all the ingredients in house, also because it‚Äôs been a favorite food since childhood. My family of Italian ladies, who could make you swoon over the simplest preparations, used to make what they called mush. They would cover a dinner plate with the soft polenta, top it with a long-simmered marinara and freshly grated aged cheeses imported from Italy. When one of the ladies made mush, word spread and we would all descend on her kitchen to slurp and laugh, very fond memories. I didn‚Äôt mean to write a novel, sorry. One brief mention. I only had coarse ground polenta, Bob‚Äôs Red Mill, and it was still creamy and smooth. I recently followed their instructions for making it in the slow cooker with vegetable broth, literally add to cooker, set and forget, no stirring, and it was perfect. Well, time to peruse which Bianca creation to make for tonight‚Äôs dinner. Thank you for these treasures and for the artistry with which they‚Äôre presented.

I‚Äôve only ever seen polenta in the cold vegan/vegetarian section at my grocery store. It comes in a tube of about 16 oz. i believe it is usually sliced and fried to make polenta cakes. Is this the same polenta you used in your recipe?
Reply
16\. March 2019 at 20:20
Hi Marissa, 
honestly, I don‚Äôt know what you mean exactly. Polenta is coarse corn flour. It‚Äôs like fine corn grits.
Reply
28\. June 2019 at 4:58
Yes, I know the polenta tubes you are referring to. For this recipe however, you would want to try and find finely ground corn grits which usually comes in a bag in a dry goods aisle or can be found in bulk bins at some stores. Best of luck!

Made this on a chilly Canadian fall night after work. (1) Was SO fast to make (2) Was SO warm and comforting (3) HELLO SO DELICIOUS. So easy with so much flavor I could cry. Had it for lunch the next day and the flavors had developed even more. 
THANKS BIANCA LOVE YOU!

Thanks for this recipe! Made a double batch for company and everyone loved it. I was a little short to double the mushrooms and spinach so I roasted some brussels sprouts for some extra veg and it worked out perfect. I never would have thought to make polenta with coconut milk AND broth, totally amazing and creamy!

Hi Bianca! My 29 year old is Vegetarian, mostly vegan plant based and tagged me for this recipe. My mouth was watering! We made it for my 52nd birthday. My choice for dinner. It was super delicious. The polenta was a nice change. We thought to throw in some sun dried tomatoes and serve over a pasta or rice next time. Will make again for sure!

Instructions
Sift together the flour, cornstarch and baking powder, and set aside.
In the bowl of a stand mixer, using the flat beater, beat the margarine or butter and icing sugar until a smooth cream is formed.
Add the egg yolks and continue beating, then add the vanilla extract and beat for 1 minute.
At medium speed, gradually add the flour mixture until a smooth thick dough is formed.
Cover with cling film and let rest for at least 3 hours in the refrigerator.
Preheat the oven to 350 F (180 ° C).
Roll out the dough to a thickness of about ¼ inch (5 mm).
Using a cookie cutter, cut circles of 1½ inches (3 to 4 cm) in diameter and place onto a baking sheet lined with parchment paper.
Repeat with the rest of the dough.
Bake for 5 to 7 minutes, or until lightly browned. The alfajores should be pale and tender (if they are left to brown for a long time, they will be crispy).
Place onto a cooling rack and allow to cool completely.
Assembly
Spread dulce de leche over the base of one of the cookies, and place another on top to form a sandwich.
Repeat for the rest of the cookies.
Roll the edges of the alfajores in grated coconut.

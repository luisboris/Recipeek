Instructions
Add the milk and vanilla pod to a pan set over a low-medium heat and heat until just beginning to simmer. Then, remove from the heat and leave to infuse â€“ the longer it is left the more pronounced the vanilla flavour will be.
Using a wooden spoon, beat the egg yolks and sugar in a separate bowl. Using a wooden spoon prevents any air being incorporated, which will help to create a dense custard.
Gradually pour in the slightly warm milk until you are left with a smooth liquid.
Pour the liquid into a clean pan and reheat over a low heat, whisking continuously. It is important to heat gently as a high temperature will result in the eggs scrambling. Continue to heat until the liquid thickens and coats the back of the wooden spoon.
Pass the liquid through a sieve into a clean bowl. If not using straight away cover with clingfilm to prevent a skin forming.

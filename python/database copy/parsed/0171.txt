Crispy Potato Nuggets
This crispy from the outside potato nuggets is sweet and spicy in the inside and the flavour is perfect and slightly cheesy. In a blender, add for tablespoons of frozen corn making with roughly chopped half an onion then add chilli flakes since the corn is sweet if you don’t eat spicy foods you can leave that out. You will also add one cheese cube and the cheese will ensure the potato nuggets are very creamy and on the inside. Blend the ingredients until you get a paste out of it. In a large mixing bowl, add the paste and add three boiled and peeled mashed potatoes then mix that together.
After mixing it briefly, add half a teaspoon of salt and mix it together until you get a very nice mixture. To make the potato nuggets, clean your hands then scoop the potato mixture depending on the size you want them to then roll them slightly into a log and then slightly flatten it to make a nugget if you are making small nuggets, you will get around 18 to 20 nuggets if making them large,m you will get about 10 to 12 nuggets.
To make the coating of these potato nuggets, add a quarter cup of cornstarch in a bowl along with a quarter cup of all-purpose flour, a little bit of salty then add little water to make a very thin batter. You will also need breadcrumbs,m on the side, take the potato nuggets and dip inside the batter mixture then coat it in the breadcrumbs. Heat oil in a wok until hot then slowly lower the nuggets and cook them until golden brown.
If you want to bake them, you will bake at 250 degrees Celcius for 15 minutes. Once the nuggets are done frying, place them on a paper-lined plate then serve with mayonnaise on the side.

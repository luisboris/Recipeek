Super Green Pasta

Thereâ€™s something really appealing about making a pesto pasta. We just love the vibrant colour and the fact itâ€™s packed with tons of nutrition and fresh flavours.
Use gluten-free pasta to make this recipe gluten-free.

This was easy to prepare in a few minutes and absolutely delicious! My partner loved them as well and thatâ€™s quite a challenge as he doesnâ€™t like much of my vegan cooking. I cooked the brocolis a bit longer so they would be softer for him. I cannot find kale where I shop so I used chards instead. Thank you for this great recipe that will be used every two weeks or so in my home!

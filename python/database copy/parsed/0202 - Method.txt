Instructions:
1. Place both flours, xanthan gum, baking powder and salt to food processor. Pulse until thoroughly combined (or combine well by hand in bowl).
2. Add vinegar while continuing to stir. Once mixed, pour in egg. Then, add water just until the dough begins to ball – it will be sticky but sturdy.
3. Wrap dough in plastic wrap. Then, knead it while wrapped 1-2 minutes. Dough should be smooth and not too cracked (small cracks are okay). If too cracked, add 1 teaspoon water and knead again.
4. Allow dough to rest for 10 minutes at room temperature. Or, save up to 5 days in refrigerator.
5. To cook stovetop: heat up a skillet or pan over medium/high heat while dough rests. Make sure pan is very hot by dropping a drop of water on it – it should sizzle.
6. Roll out dough between two sheets of parchment paper with a rolling pin. Get it as thin as possible and around 12 inches in diameter. Fold over edges by pressing with wet fingertips.
7. Cook the pizza crust in your pre-heated skillet. Cook on the first side for about 2 minutes or until blistered. Then, lower heat to medium/low. Flip over pizza crust, add toppings, cover pan with lid, and cook 2-3 minutes until all toppings are melted/cook and dough is cooked on the bottom.
8. Makes one crust with slices. Enjoy immediately.

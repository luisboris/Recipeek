Method
1. Brown the cubed bread in the oven: 
Pre-heat oven to 350°F. Toss the cubed bread with a tablespoon of olive oil, sprinkle with a little salt. Arrange bread on a baking sheet and toast for 20-30 minutes (check timing!) or until nicely browned.

2. Gently cook the sliced onions, add the garlic: 
While the cubed bread is in the oven, prepare the onions. Heat 2 tablespoons olive oil and the butter on medium heat in a 5- to 7-quart Dutch oven. Add the onions and stir to coat with the butter and oil. Cook gently, stirring occasionally for 10 to 15 minutes. 
If the onions begin to dry out at all, lower the heat. They should begin to caramelize and lightly brown. 
Add the garlic, cook for a minute more, remove from heat.

3. Dry sauté the mushrooms: 
While the onions are browning, heat a large sauté pan on medium-high heat. Add the sliced mushrooms. "Dry" sauté them (sauté without any added fat) until they release their moisture and are lightly browned.

4. Prep the chard: 
Cut away the tough central stems of the chard leaves. Cut across the leaves into 1-inch wide strips.

5. Layer Dutch oven with onions, chard, mushrooms, bread, spices: 
Remove half of the browned onions from the Dutch oven and set aside. Spread the remaining onions evenly over the bottom of the pot. 
Layer over with half of the chard and half of the browned mushrooms. Sprinkle with pepper, half a teaspoon of salt, and thyme.

Put down a layer of toasted bread cubes. Add the remaining onions, chard, and mushrooms. Layer on top the remaining bread cubes. 
6. Add honey wine mixture and stock: 
Mix together the honey and wine, until the honey is dissolved. Pour over the bread mixture. Pour the broth over everything. 
7. Scatter the top evenly with the grated cheese

8. Bake in oven: 
Cover the pot with foil (not the lid) and seal it around the edges. Cut 4 or 5 vent holes in the top. Put it in a 350°F (175°C) oven. Bake for 1 hour 15 minutes. Serve immediately, digging into the layers to get a bit of everything for each portion, or let cool and refrigerate, covered. 
To reheat, gently simmer a portion until hot. Plate and garnish with additional cheese and thyme.

I have lots of lilly pilly berries on my tree so I made this jam. \- sam/sherpa
Ingredients
2 cups lilly pilly berries, washed
1 cup sugar
Water
Juice 2 lemons
Method
1. Place berries in large saucepan and pour over enough water to barely cover berries. 
2. Bring to the boil and boil for 1 hour or until berries are soft. 
3. Strain berries through a muslin cloth, do not push through as this will make jam cloudy. 
4. Place liquid back into saucepan and add 1 cup sugar per cup of liquid and add lemon juice. 
5. Boil. Test by placing a small amount of jelly onto a cold saucer and when given a shake wrinkles appear. 
6. Jelly is then ready to be placed into sterilized jars.

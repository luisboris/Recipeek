Step 1
Pave the bottom of a large, shallow terra-cotta or enameled cast-iron casserole with the bread. Warm the milk and the cream to the point just before it simmers. Permit the milk/cream to cool for a minute or two, then beat in the eggs. Pour half the still-hot milk/cream/egg mixture over the bread. Sprinkle on half the sea salt, generous grindings of pepper, and half the pecorino. Repeat the procedure with the remaining bread, hot milk/cream/egg, sea salt, more pepper, and the pecorino. Cover the pudding with a clean kitchen towel and permit the bread to inhale its warm, creamy bath for 1/2 hour.
Step 2
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.
Step 3
In a small saut√© pan over a medium flame, warm the olive oil and soften the garlic, taking care not to let it color. Add the chile pepper and roll it about for 1 minute, scenting the oil. Just before baking the pudding, thread the perfumed oil evenly over it.
Step 4
Bake the pudding for 35 to 40 minutes or until it is deeply golden.

Chickpea cookie dough dessert hummus is a creamy refined sugar free dip that’s also vegan and gluten free. Make this 10-minute recipe for a dessert platter or quick nourishing snack!_
We’re at the halfway mark of unrefined sugar recipes month! Valentine’s Day has come and gone, but the natural sweetness and love continue!
When I’m creating new recipes, I like to use ingredients that are nourishing, of course. But beyond that, it’s a jackpot when I can incorporate foods that have a mild or neutral flavor. This makes them easy to adapt to either a savory or sweet flavor. 
Chickpeas are a perfect example of this!
So, what are chickpeas?
Also known as garbanzo beans, the chickpea is a type of legume.
The most common type has a round shape and a beige color, but they also come in black, green, and red varieties. You can buy them raw or in cans, cooked and ready to use.
Nutritionally, these little beans are:
naturally gluten free
good source of plant-based protein
high in fiber, iron, and folate
lower in glycemic index than starches like potatoes 
Their creamy texture and nutty flavor make them the perfect peanut substitute, and almost everyone knows they are the base for hummus dip, but they can be used for SO many other delicious things! 
I like to dry roast chickpeas for a simple, healthy snack, and I’ll often add them to salads. This Moroccan Style Salad with Chickpeas and Quinoa is one of my favorites! But my favorite way to use them is to make sweet treats, like chickpea cookie dough!
Chickpea cookie dough dessert hummus
You only need a handful of basic ingredients to make this recipe, and I bet you have most of them on hand already!
Ingredients
Canned chickpeas , rinsed and skins removed. If you want to cook your own, you’ll need about 1.5 cups after removing the skins.
No-stir nut butter or sunflower seed butter – If you use sunflower seed butter, be aware that it will turn green when baking soda is added to it.
Coconut oil
Maple syrup – If you don’t need a vegan option, honey also works
Baking soda – This may seem like a strange ingredient for dessert hummus, but this article from Eating Well explains the benefits of adding baking soda to beans.
Coconut milk – coconut cream and non-dairy cream are good substitutes
Sugar-free powdered sugar – If you prefer a less sweet flavor, you can omit this. We used a sugar free powdered sugar made with monk fruit to keep is refined sugar free.
Sugar free white chocolate chips and/or dark chocolate dips. I like using Lily’s chocolates or Enjoy Life foods vegan dark chocolate chips.
Recipe notes
For a smoother, creamier texture : Removing the chickpea skins makes the dip A LOT smoother and silkier, like a dessert hummus! It’s worth the extra step and it’s very easy to do.
To adjust the sweetness \-- You can adjust the sweetness of the chickpea cookie dough by adding more or less maple syrup or powdered sugar. I use monk fruit powdered sugar to make it refined sugar free.

This unrefined sugar snack doesn’t get much easier to make. The most time consuming part is removing the skins. After that, you just toss everything into your food processor and blend it up!

Do you have to remove chickpea skins? Nope, not really. They’re completely edible, but as I said earlier, removing them gives the dessert hummus a creamier texture.
Serving suggestions
For a fun party idea, serve your chickpea cookie dough hummus dip on a dessert platter. Fill it up with fresh fruit, berries, gluten free (refined sugar free), pretzels, homemade vegan cookies, graham crackers, dark chocolate, etc.
I have some other ideas for using chickpeas to create unrefined sugar treats, too! Save the water from the can and use it to create aquafaba. Or, maybe a pan of Cinnamon Chickpea Blondies.

One last note; this is a great dessert/snack dip to make with the kids or for kids with food allergies! They won’t even know there’s fiber in it. Hehe!

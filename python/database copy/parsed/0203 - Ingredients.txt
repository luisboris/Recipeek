Ingredients
400 gr (14 oz) of corn flour for polenta – Packages labeled “polenta” mean that the grind of the corn is appropriate to make the polenta dish, but you can substitute coarsely-ground cornmeal instead.
1, 5 liters of water
1 tablespoon of coarse salt
NOTE
Proportions between water and corn are mportant for the preparation of polenta. In fact you can make polenta with different consistencies: soft to eat with cheeses or hard and firm to eat as an accompaniment to meat sauces or stews. The classic ratio is 1 part polenta to 4 parts of water for a medium consistency as in this recipe. Below the ratio for a more or less hard polenta:
1 liter of water + 300 g (10,50 oz) of corn flour for a firm polenta
1 liter of water + 250 g (8,8 oz) of corn flour for a medium consistency
1 liter of water + 200 g (7 oz) of corn flour for a very soft polenta.

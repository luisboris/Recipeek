Traditional British Custard
When it’s cold and chilly outside, nothing is more comforting than a warm bowl of homemade custard, whether you enjoy it on its own, over a simple banana or served over a delicious steamed pudding. Recipe via Great British Chefs.
search Puddings
Ingredients
350 ml of milk
2 egg yolks
25 g of sugar
1 vanilla pod
Instructions
Add the milk and vanilla pod to a pan set over a low-medium heat and heat until just beginning to simmer. Then, remove from the heat and leave to infuse – the longer it is left the more pronounced the vanilla flavour will be.
Using a wooden spoon, beat the egg yolks and sugar in a separate bowl. Using a wooden spoon prevents any air being incorporated, which will help to create a dense custard.
Gradually pour in the slightly warm milk until you are left with a smooth liquid.
Pour the liquid into a clean pan and reheat over a low heat, whisking continuously. It is important to heat gently as a high temperature will result in the eggs scrambling. Continue to heat until the liquid thickens and coats the back of the wooden spoon.
Pass the liquid through a sieve into a clean bowl. If not using straight away cover with clingfilm to prevent a skin forming.

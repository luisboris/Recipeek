Instructions
Cut a slit lengthwise in each eggplant and roast on stove, grill or in the oven.
Set the eggplants aside to cool down for 10 minutes.
Scoop the pulp out and place in a colander lined with cheese cloth or a clean kitchen towel to drain excess liquids.
Place the pulp on a cutting board and chop with a sharp knife then put in a deep bowl.
In a jar or a small bowl combine garlic, olive oil, lime juice, vinegar, salt and pepper.
Pour the vinaigrette over the eggplant and mix well.
Taste to adjust seasoning.
Mix in the green onions. Refrigerate for 1-2 hours before serving.
When ready to serve, garnish with olives and whatever you choose and drizzle some olive oil on top.

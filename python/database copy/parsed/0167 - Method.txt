Instructions
1. Heat oven to 375. Separate crescent dough into 16 triangles and place on a greased, round pizza pan with points toward the center.
2. Press onto the bottom and up the sides of pan to form a crust; seal seams. Bake for 11-13 minutes or until golden brown.
3. Meanwhile, prepare gravy according to package directions in a medium saucepan. Stir sausage crumbles into thickened gravy; set aside.
4. In a small bowl, whisk together the eggs, milk, salt and pepper. In a large skillet, heat butter over medium heat.
5. Add egg mixture; cook and stir until almost set. Spread sausage gravy mixture over the crust. Top with eggs and cheeses.
6. Bake 5-10 minutes longer or until eggs are set and cheese is melted. Cut into wedges.

Pitta is a typical Easter dish in Calabria and is typically eaten the same day it is made. Pitta is perfect for picnics as a slice can be held easily in one hand.The flavour is a bit like a Calabrian croque madame with its salty prosciutto and salami, creamy mozzarella and nutritious egg encased in a crisp bread shell. 
It is said that the pitta was made as a way to test the temperature of the wood ovens. Pitta has many variations and can be stuffed with combinations such as tinned tuna, tomatoes, green olives, onions and oregano; cooked aubergine/eggplant, spicy fennel sausage, scamorza and tomato; black olives, anchovies, salami and Tropea onion; or aubergine, garlic, chillies, tomatoes, mozzarella and basil.

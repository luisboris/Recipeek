Put yeast and shredded wheat biscuits in the warm water to soak for 5 minutes. Add soup, brown sugar, molasses, salt, linguiça drippings, shortening and diced linguiça. Add the beaten egg and mix until blended. Add 2 cups flour and beat until smooth. Add remaining flour and knead until dough is smooth and not sticky. Let rise for one-half hour. Grease three 9x 5 loaf pans. Divide the dough into 3 parts and place in the pans. When the dough has risen to the top of the pans, bake the bread at 350° for 40 minutes. Take a stick of butter and rub on the top of each loaf. Place the loaves on a wire rack to cool.
Yield: 3 one-pound loaves.

Do NOT miss this delicious hashbrown casserole recipe. It is SO good and has a yummy Ritz Cracker topping. Perfect for any meal!_
Hashbrown Casserole Recipe – The Perfect Dish!
Every year for Easter Sunday, I make this Hashbrown Casserole along with some other yummy dishes for our Easter Menu Plan. This cheesy hashbrown dish is SO GOOD and the whole family loves it. The secret is in the topping – crushed Ritz crackers!
This hash brown casserole uses frozen hash browns so you don't have to worry about the potatoes browning. This is such a popular recipe and is an easy potato casserole to make up in advance. Everyone seems to love it!
TIP: This delicious casserole is also included in ourCelebration Menu Planning Made Easy Set! 
This can be used as a side dish with a dinner or can easily be a casserole dish that you serve as a brunch. It is ready to bake in just a few minutes after you put all the ingredients together and then bakes uncovered for about 30 – 45 minutes in a preheated oven.
Ingredients needed:
shredded hashbrowns
margarine or butter sticks
cream of chicken soup ( _you can also make your ownhomemade cream soup too!_)
sour cream
shredded cheddar cheese
onion
Ritz crackers (crushed – for the topping)
To make your hashbrown casserole, you'll want to mix together your ingredients in large bowl and transfer to 9 x 13 pan. Next, crush up your Ritz crackers and combine with melted butter to make your topping.
Bake for about 30 minutes to 45 minutes uncovered (it always seems to take mine 40 minutes – just check your center to make sure they are cooked through). Your cheesy potato dish will be ready to enjoyed by all in no time!

Instructions
Pre-heat the oven to 355 ºF (180 ºC) and line an 8x8 inch (20x20 cm) baking pan with greaseproof/baking paper.
In a heat-proof bowl above a pot of simmering water, melt the dark chocolate and coconut oil together. Set aside.
Using a stand mixer with the whisk attachment, or a hand mixer with the double beater attachments, whisk the eggs and coconut sugar until pale, fluffy and tripled in volume. This will take about 5 - 7 minutes.
Slowly drizzle in the melted chocolate while whisking on low speed. Whisk until the chocolate is fully incorporated.
Sift the almond flour, cocoa powder and salt into the egg-chocolate mixture, and gently fold in the dry ingredients (using a spatula) until no clumps remain.
Stir most of the chocolate chunks and chips into the brownie batter, then transfer the batter into the prepared baking pan. Smooth out the top, and sprinkle over the rest of the chocolate chunks and chips.
Bake in the pre-heated oven at 355 ºF (180 ºC) for 18 - 20 minutes, or until an inserted toothpick comes out with moist crumbs attached (for fudgy brownies) or even with some half-baked batter attached (for gooey brownies).
Serve the brownies either still warm or once cooled.
The healthy brownies keep well in a cool dry place in a closed container for 3 - 4 days.

Spanakopita Shakshuka
Shakshuka, a classic egg dish in Middle Eastern cuisine, is also made, by various different names, throughout Greece. Greek recipes, indeed, abound for eggs cooked in greens and/or tomato sauces. They tend to be great examples of satisfying and healthy Mediterranean diet dishes. This one is a particular favorite, created in my Athens kitchen, using the filling for a real Greek classic, spanakopita, and the basic idea of cooking eggs in greens! Perfect for a Mediterranean diet breakfast, brunch or quick meal!

Ingredients
3 tablespoons extra virgin Greek olive oil
2 scallions trimmed and chopped
1 red onion chopped
8 cups chopped fresh or frozen defrosted spinach
2/3 cup crumbled Greek feta
Pinch of grated nutmeg
4 large eggs
Salt and pepper to taste
Barley rusk Cretan Dako or toasted bread
Instructions
1. Heat the olive oil in a 10- or 12-inch nonstick skillet over medium heat. Add the scallions and onions and cook until soft, about 8 minutes. Add the spinach, season with salt and pepper and cook until all its liquid has evaporated, about 10 – 12 minutes. Add the nutmeg, pepper, and feta cheese. Lower heat.
2. Using a wooden spoon, make 4 hollows in the spinach mixture. Carefully break and egg into each of them. Cook over low heat until the eggs are set to desired doneness. They should not be runny.
3. As the eggs cook, break apart each of the barley rusks into two halves. Dampen under the tap and let the water drip off. Place on individual serving plates. When the eggs are done, carefully divide the mixture with a spatula and serve one egg and the spinach mixture over each of the rusks or toast pieces. You can use good toasted whole grain bread instead of the rusks as well.

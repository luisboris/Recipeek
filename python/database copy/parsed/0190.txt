This beautiful, Grilled Vegetables Platter with Yogurt Mint Sauce is so colorful and delicious. An easy summer side dish made with asparagus, zucchini, squash, red onion and bell peppers.
Grilled Vegetables with Yogurt Mint Sauce
Grilled vegetables are perfect to make as a side dish with anything you’re grilling such as grilled pesto chicken or grilled salmon, or they can be served as a main dish or appetizer.
I love this easy yogurt dipping sauce made with Greek yogurt, fresh mint, garlic and olive oil. Partnering with Stonyfield, my favorite organic yogurt brand to create this easy dip with their Stonyfield Plain 0% Fat Greek Yogurt but their Whole Milk Greek Plain would be great too. I have spearmint growing wild in my garden which gives this dip a sweet freshness I love, but honestly any fresh herb such as chives or parsley would also taste great.
Why Purchase Organic Dairy?
It’s better for you. Because it comes from cows that are actively grazing on grass, as nature intended. Organically raised cows spend their days outside on pasture so the milk they produce is significantly higher in Omega-3 fatty acids and CLA (conjugated linoleic acid), heart-healthy fats that can help lower bad cholesterol and increase good cholesterol. There’s also compelling evidence that many organic fruits and veggies are more nutritious, too.
It’s better for our children’s health. Research has demonstrated that an organic diet can dramatically reduce pesticide levels in kids’ bodies.
It’s good for the planet. One of the main goals of organic farming practices is to avoid soil contamination as well as rivers, drinking water, and air with toxic persistent chemicals.
It’s also better for the farmer and their neighbors , as they aren’t exposed to potentially carcinogenic herbicides.
It’s better for the bees.
You can make the yogurt dipping sauce a day ahead, it will last 3 to 4 days refrigerated.
Grilled Vegetable Variations
You can swap any of the vegetables out here and replace with eggplant, baby carrots, tomatoes, etc,

Wow!!! This recipe is amazing. I don’t usually like zucchini or squash and with this I was going back for more!!!! I sliced them thin and charred them so the texture was crispy. So delish!!!!! And the yogurt sauce was the perfect compliment.

This was delicious and so easy!!!

Of all the BBQ veggie recipes I have tried, this one is my favorite
4. Felicia Schaps — September 22, 2019 @ 4:54 pm Reply
Can this be made in an oven or on the stovetop. Don’t have a grill
Gina — September 23, 2019 @ 8:37 am Reply
Sure a grill pan on the stove works.

Are your WW SP values based on the original SPs or the new Freestyle SPs? I prefer the old version. Thank you.

I made this for a Fourth of July party and it was a huge hit! Vegetables can be served room temperature and the sauce is so refreshing! 
7. Andrea Leigh Fletcher — June 30, 2019 @ 3:03 pm Reply
Hi Gina, 
Do you think fresh basil would be a good alternative to the mint?
Gina — June 30, 2019 @ 4:26 pm Reply
Sure!
8. Susan lentini — June 30, 2019 @ 2:08 pm Reply
Such a good recipe Gina! This will be a regular in my rotation. I can eat these veggies every day. Loved it!

I made this last night and it is the PERFECT summer side dish. The yogurt mint sauce is amazing. Super refreshing on a warm evening – I ended up putting it on everything. And the Za’atar seasonings on the grilled vegetables was addictive. My husband asked me to keep this in our “weekly rotation” so I know it was delicious! Thanks Gina!

Hi Gina! This looks amazing!! I’m just not a mint fan (other than cookies – ha!). What would you recommend as a sub? Thanks for all you do to keep us on track, full and happy! 🙂

I made this recipe right away since I had everything at home for it, and the mint sauce was even fantastic on top of my burger. I totally loved it! I halved the sauce recipe since there’s only two of us, but kept the same amount of garlic – pros: really delicious, cons: my breath could kill a vampire. Thanks for the great recipe! 🙂

Where do you get or what is in the Zataar seasoning???.
Cynthia — August 3, 2020 @ 8:10 pm Reply
I bought it at a local middle eastern store. 
13. Janessa — June 26, 2019 @ 3:06 pm Reply
What is Zataar seasoning? I’m in Canada but Ive never heard of it. Where can it be purchased? 
Gina — June 26, 2019 @ 5:24 pm Reply
It’s a dry mix, I found this recipe to make 5 tbsp: 2 tablespoons minced fresh thyme, 2 tablespoons sesame seeds, 2 teaspoons ground sumac, 1/2 teaspoon coarse salt

I love grilled vegetables, and this looks like a great recipe. But I haven’t found a grilling basket/pan that I like. They’re too hard to get clean. I’m considering trying a grill mat. But what do you use for vegetables on the grill? Thanks for any suggestions you can offer.
Lisa — June 28, 2019 @ 8:26 am Reply
I use a super cheap grate from the dollar store. I’m in Canada, but I think they have them in the US at grocery stores and such. They are super thin, ok for 4 or 5 uses (I just brush mine with the grill brush). 
Very similar to this..

You usually link to the product you like to use….
do you have a favorite Zaatar brand that you like for your mint yogurt sauce?
Gina — June 26, 2019 @ 5:26 pm Reply
Sure this is the brand I use https://www.amazon.com/Zaatar-Penzeys-Spices-cup-jar/dp/B06XCNXMH6/ref=sr_1_24?keywords=zatar&qid=1561587950&s=grocery&sr=1-24&th=1

Debbie, 
Check out the Penzey’s website. Their spices are amazing! I have a store near my house and am on sensory overload when I got in the door, it smells so good! 
If you get on the mailing list, there’s often free giveaways with orders, etc.

parotta recipe | kerala paratha recipe | malabar paratha recipe with step by step photo and video recipe. generally, south indian recipes are known for the rice or lentil-based dishes which are natively produced and used. wheat or plain flour-based flatbreads are less common with many south indians. yet there are some variations of flatbreads and are served for morning breakfast. one of the most common bread recipes is the layered parotta recipe known for its flaky texture.
to be honest, i am not a huge fan of plain flour-based recipes or snacks made out of maida. yet i have a special obsession with the layered parotta recipe. it could be for the fact that malabar paratha is the only bread popularly consumed in south india. while i was doing my college, i did not have exposure to the exotic punjabi or north indian parathas. i had just one option, and i was happy with it. even today, i love the combination of spicy kurma with a flaky and layered parotta. even though these days i personally do not take the effort of making these parathas from scratch and i get frozen from my local grocery shop. also, i get the wheat-based ones and i prefer those for my day to day use.
furthermore, i would like to conclude by adding some more tips, suggestions, and variations to kerala paratha recipe. firstly, the traditional parotta or also known as roti cannoi is made with plain flour or maida flour. however due to health concerns many readers prefer wheat flour. you can absolutely prepare it with wheat flour but you may not get the same flakiness and crisp. secondly, once the parathas are cooked and fried, you need to immediately crush it. otherwise, you may not get the same layers and flaky texture. lastly, try making small-sized paratha first, and do not attempt with the bigger size. you may find it difficult to deal with the gluten of maida. it would pull back to shrink in size.
finally, i request you to check my other detailed paratha recipes collection with this post of kerala paratha recipe. it includes my other detailed recipe variations like, parotta, dahi paratha, spring onion paratha, sweet potato paratha, bread paratha, namak mirch paratha, cabbage paratha, masala paratha, garlic paratha, tomato paratha. further to these i would also like to highlight my other recipe categories like,

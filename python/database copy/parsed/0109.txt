Pumpkin Spice Sugar Scrub: Great for Gifting
The recipe makes enough for three half pint jars of sugar scrub, so you will have plenty to share. It only takes a few minutes to make a batch, so why not make two or more batches and make everyone happy. Pumpkin Spice Sugar Scrub would also be a great craft to make for fall school & church bazaars.
MyPumpkin Spice Bath Bombs and Pumpkin Spice Soap are also great gift choices. Why not make them all and create gift baskets?
Very purposely there is no actual pumpkin in this Pumpkin Spice Sugar Scrub recipe. This is to keep the scrub from spoiling. The orange color of the scrub is obtained with gel food coloring.

Simply print the labels out on cardstock paper, cut out and glue on the caps of the jars. I use a basic all-purpose glue. just make sure to spread the glue on thinly, and smooth out as you adhere the labels.

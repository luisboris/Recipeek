Circassian Holiday Cookies
Recipes __0
Circassian cuisine is simple and generally aims to give as much calories as possible with minimal load and raw materials. Flour is an essential component of most Circassian foods. “Laqom” or Circassian cookies are usually served with tea on occasions and serve as snacks while traveling as they maintain their characteristics for many days.
We would like to thank Mrs. Shan Tsai from Jordan, for her contribution.

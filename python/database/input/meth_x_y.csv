Did you know that Apple Strudel is not really a German pastry? It originated in Austria and is popular in many countries in Europe that once belonged to the Austro-Hungarian Empire. Germany wasn’t part of this empire but many popular Austrian dishes like Kaiserschmarrn or Apfelstrudel are also part of the Bavarian cuisine because of the proximity to Austria.,30,2.7,15.62962962962963,10.947368421052632,4.666666666666667,6.75,31.903225806451612,22.44,0,0,0,0,0

"Traditional Viennese Apple Strudel is made with strudel dough. A soft dough made with only a handful of ingredients that’s hand-stretched into a paper-thin sheet the size of a tabletop. But many are afraid of making a strudel dough, so recipes these days often cheat by using sheets of purchased phyllo dough or puff pastry.",31,31.903225806451612,4.666666666666667,2.7,6.75,22.44,12.533333333333333,20.5,0,0,0,0,0

"Start with making the dough. This dough recipe is pretty straightforward. Melted butter, flour, lukewarm water, and a little bit of salt are combined until a smooth dough forms.

Now comes a step that will make stretching the dough so much easier. Let the dough rest in a hot small pot covered with a lid. This makes the dough elastic and easier to handle.,20,54.6,12.533333333333333,20.5,51.74074074074074,13.0,30.9,2.3333333333333335,0,0,0,0,0

While the dough is resting make the apple filling. You want it to be ready before you start rolling out and stretching the dough because if the dough gets dry it will tear and you might end up with a huge mess. While testing this recipe I nearly had a breakdown because my strudel ripped open in the oven and the apple filling spilled out.,30,30.9,51.74074074074074,54.6,13.0,2.3333333333333335,18.96551724137931,33.333333333333336,0,0,0,0,0

I have a made a French tart with a much simpler procedure and have come out good. Being the first time with this recipe I ended having too much apple filling even I used 4 small apples. The dough rolls better if you make it right on the parchment paper you are going to bake it. Other than that it came out delicious. Thanks Julia!!

"Hi Julia, I’m very much a newbie at this baking game haha, and don’t have the luxury of a stand mixer or the worktop space for one (London kitchen sizes are naff unless you earn a fortune!

The recipe is making my mouth water already but I’m ‘confused.com’ about the rolling up and the six-inch strip, as to which direction the filling is laid out and then rolled.

"Pizza fritta is one of the oldest forms of pizza, the classic street food of Naples, where it was easier to cook more using oil than managing a wood oven. The texture is almost doughnut-like on the outside, and creamy in the middle. Tweak this simple filling by adding any of your favourite ingredients to gently melt inside. ” ",30,18.133333333333333,4.0,4.0,2.2,0.0,14.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0

"Make your dough, proving it for 1 hour, rather than overnight, and your Hero tomato sauce. When the time’s up, divide the dough into 12 balls on a flour-dusted surface, dust them with flour, cover with a clean damp tea towel, and rest for 10 minutes.

"One at a time, press out a ball of dough with your fingers, stretching and flattening it into a 15cm round. Finely grate the Parmesan and beat with the ricotta, then add a heaped spoonful to your dough round. Tear over a little mozzarella, season, push a few basil leaves into the top, then fold over the dough to seal the filling inside. Press down to stick, twisting and tucking the dough, if needed, like pizza ravioli! Repeat. ",42,34.976190476190474,15.0,304.0,42.91304347826087,34.05555555555556,0.8333333333333334,16.0,0,0,0,0,1
"Heat the vegetable oil in a large, sturdy pan over a medium-high heat. Drop in a cube of potato and when it’s golden and rises to the surface, the oil is ready. I’m not a lover of deep-frying but it does give the best results here – please be careful. Working in batches, lower in two fritte to cook for 1½ minutes on each side, or until golden. Remove to a plate lined with kitchen paper to drain, then let the oil come back up to temperature before adding the next two. Warm the tomato sauce and serve on the side for dunking. Sprinkle more fresh basil leaves over the fritte, to serve. ",54,34.05555555555556,304.0,42.91304347826087,34.976190476190474,0.8333333333333334,16.0,7.666666666666667,0,0,0,0,1

The blueberry season is on! I’ve picked wild blueberries since I was a kid & I love foraging in the forest. Being in nature is calming and sharing that moment with family and friends is unique. This time around we asked our countryside neighbors to come along with us.,25,2.52,0.0,32.0,0,3.433333333333333,6.6923076923076925,1.3333333333333333,0,0,0,0,0
"Our cottage neighbors are an old retired couple, amazing people, bubbly personalities. Laughter and chatter accompanied us for 3 hours together in the forest. It was also special to listen to someone humming during the quiet moments. All in all, berry foraging is one kind of shared mindfulness and I warmly recommend it.",30,3.433333333333333,32.0,0,2.52,6.6923076923076925,1.3333333333333333,6.0,0,0,0,0,0

One of the traditions after the first forest adventure of the season is making some kind of berry dessert. My all-time favorite wild blueberry dessert is not the classic blueberry pie but _“Mustikkakukko”_ which in English translates to Blueberry Rooster.,22,2.727272727272727,6.6923076923076925,1.3333333333333333,6.0,6.466666666666667,1.0,0,0,0,0,0,0
"The Blueberry Rooster is basically a slow-cooked covered rye pastry served with vanilla ice cream. Nothing to do with a real rooster haha. This rustic dessert originating from Eastern Finland is absolutely delicious. Because I didn’t have enough rye flour, I opted for a wild blueberry rye galette this time.",30,6.466666666666667,1.3333333333333333,6.0,2.727272727272727,1.0,0,2.5,0,0,0,0,0

"Since blueberries and rye might be a bit of odd flavor pair to most, I can assure you that this is something that you must try. Wild blueberries taste completely different in comparison to blueberries. They have an intense and sweet taste of the forest.

The base for this cake is a fluffy chocolate sponge cake that gets its special texture from whipped egg whites. The egg whites make the cake rise and fluffy.,18,19.27777777777778,1.7619047619047619,23.5,26.8,14.25925925925926,31.75,17.8,0,0,0,0,0

Using a serrated bread knife is the easiest way to cut the cake into three layers. Try to hold the knife as horizontal as possible and work slowly. Use a piece of cardboard or a special cake board to lift the layers off. This makes it also easier to transfer the layers back when you assemble the cake. ,32,16.75,14.25925925925926,31.75,17.8,31.2,13.608695652173912,12.27027027027027,0,0,0,0,0

You will need a lot of whipped cream for this cake. I use a KitchenAid Professional so whipping up 4 cups of heavy cream is no problem. But if you’re using a smaller stand mixer or hand mixer it will be best to whip the cream in two batches.,23,13.608695652173912,17.8,16.75,31.2,12.27027027027027,12.625,3.3333333333333335,0,0,0,0,0
The higher the fat content of the cream the better it will whip up. Heavy whipping cream usually has a fat percentage of 35% which works best. If you have difficulties getting the cream to stiffen up I recommend putting the whisk and bowl in the freezer for about an hour and making sure that the heavy cream is cold.

"Reasons why your sponge cake might have turned out flat, collapsed after baking or is dense and compact",10,13.4,21.51851851851852,17.0,19.714285714285715,15.041666666666666,21.142857142857142,34.0,0,0,0,0,0
1. Not enough air incorporated: Make sure to beat the egg yolk sugar mixture until thick and pale and don’t overbeat the egg whites. You want to have as many tiny air bubbles as possible because they act as a leaving agent.,24,15.041666666666666,17.0,19.714285714285715,13.4,21.142857142857142,34.0,16.055555555555557,0,0,0,1,0
2. Stirring instead of folding: The egg yolk mixture or the flour mixture was stirred into the egg whites and not gently folded with a spatula or spoon. Stirring the mixture makes the tiny air bubbles which make the cake fluffy and act as a leaving agent pop.,28,21.142857142857142,19.714285714285715,13.4,15.041666666666666,34.0,16.055555555555557,29.11111111111111,0,0,0,1,0
3. Greasing the sides of the baking pan: Don’t line the sides of the pan with parchment paper or grease it! Only the bottom of the pan should be lined with parchment paper. The sponge will not rise during baking or collapse after taking it out of the oven if the sides of the pan are greased because the batter will slide down.,26,34.0,13.4,15.041666666666666,21.142857142857142,16.055555555555557,29.11111111111111,24.72222222222222,0,0,0,1,0
4. Waiting too long to bake: The sponge cake needs to be baked immediately after folding in the flour mixture. Letting it sit out for too long makes the air bubbles pop.,18,16.055555555555557,15.041666666666666,21.142857142857142,34.0,29.11111111111111,24.72222222222222,10.733333333333333,0,0,0,1,0

"I have never made the cake in a 9×13 pan but I would double the recipe. I don’t recommend using maraschino cherries (or the syrup of maraschino cherries), they are a lot sweeter than normal cherries and would change the whole cake. You can use them as a garnish. If you don’t want to use kirsch you can just leave it out. You could add instant coffee to the cake mix if you like, it intensifies the chocolate flavor.

is there any way to make this like the trend “letter cakes” that are on social media lately?

This was easy to prepare in a few minutes and absolutely delicious! My partner loved them as well and that’s quite a challenge as he doesn’t like much of my vegan cooking. I cooked the brocolis a bit longer so they would be softer for him. I cannot find kale where I shop so I used chards instead.

"Polenta, as Katie Caldesi rather politely puts it in her Italian Cookery Course, is one of those things that often ""leaves the British wondering"" – Angela Hartnett is more blunt when she admits that you either love or hate the stuff. Unlike a certain yeast-based spread, I'm not sure it's anything personal, however; if polenta is done properly, then it is one of the most comforting things imaginable. Cook it badly, and even the dog won't touch it (I speak from experience).",43,5.511627906976744,0.0,0.0,0.0,4.583333333333333,1.4666666666666666,12.162162162162161,0,0,0,0,0
"In fact, fancy polenta has a lot in common with our own beloved mashed potato, in that it teeters dangerously between grey, lumpy, mass-produced mess, and fluffy, buttery manna.

"As with many staple foods, polenta is very close to the hearts of northern Italians.

"Much myth surrounds its proper preparation: the late Marcella Hazan describes the cooking as a ""ritual, eating it like receiving a sacrament"" – which makes it quite a daunting prospect for a novice.

"Polenta, of course, isn't polenta until it's cooked – until then it's just cornmeal (which is a good tip if you're on a budget: cornmeal labelled as such tends to be an awful lot cheaper than anything labelled polenta).

"The white stuff, which has a more delicate flavour, is more common in Venezia region, where it pairs beautifully with seafood. I'm after something to go with vast amounts of cheese, or meaty ragu, so I decided to stick to yellow in its two most common forms: fine and coarse.

"I've always cooked cornmeal in water, regarding it in much the same way as pasta or rice.

"Stock is nice, but overpowers the flavour of the corn itself: though seasoning is essential, I think polenta should provide a starchy, bland foil to something more strongly flavoured.

"Stirring is a contentious issue. Hazan says: ""Stirring polenta in an open pot for the entire time it cooks undoubtedly yields the best product, most in terms of fragrance and, to a certain but lesser extent, in terms of flavour."" Nevertheless, she concedes it is possible to make ""very good polenta with hardly any stirring"" – and Del Conte, the River Café, Locatelli, Oliver and Ferrigno agree, all giving recipes that involve stirring frequently, but not continuously.",44,8.227272727272727,38.0,5.6,5.6,12.169230769230769,8.666666666666666,8.666666666666666,0,0,0,0,0
"Caldesi, however, after citing ""many an Italian nonna's"" belief that ""the longer you cook polenta, the better the texture"", has me stirring continuously for 45 minutes. (At least she admits that, though this is traditionally done clockwise, really the direction doesn't matter.) By the end of it, I'm losing the will to live – and all for scant reward, because my polenta is unpleasantly claggy, suggesting either it has cooked too fast or I've not added enough liquid. Stirring it more frequently than the River Café's ""from time to time"" is a good idea, however, as it has a habit of catching in most pans, and it is wise to keep an eye on its progress in any case. Locatelli's every five minutes seems about right, though play it by ear according to how yours looks.",65,12.169230769230769,5.6,5.6,8.227272727272727,8.666666666666666,8.666666666666666,19.57894736842105,0,0,0,0,0

"Del Conte gives an alternative which starts off by stirring the polenta in the pan for 10 minutes as normal, then pouring it into a dish, covering with buttered foil and baking for an hour.

"Caldesi simmers her polenta with a bay leaf, but I find this gets smashed up during my stirring marathon, leaving me with lots of stringy bits to pick out. Ferrigno suggests a whole range of different flavourings to stir in at the end, including crushed garlic and fresh herbs, which I love, but they do detract from the flavour of the corn itself. If you prefer to keep it simple, Hartnett's butter is a must, and her grated parmesan can't really be bettered – though a few strips of lardo, some venison ragu or a bit of crumbled gorgonzola aren't too shabby an alternative.

"A creamy, cheesy polenta that isn’t as high maintenance as you’d expect. Despite its reputation, polenta does not need to be whisked constantly and attentively for 30 minutes straight. As long as you cook it gently, over low heat, you can get away with whisking it only a few times as it cooks. This recipe is from Montreal’s cozy-cool coffee-pizza-wine restaurant Elena (and goes great with this pork roast).",33,18.848484848484848,0.0,0.0,1.0,29.0,5.0,17.666666666666668,0,0,0,0,0

"Bring milk and 3 cups water to a boil over medium-high heat in a medium saucepan. Reduce heat to medium. Whisking constantly, gradually add polenta; bring to a simmer. Reduce heat to low, cover pan, and cook, whisking every 10–15 minutes, until thickened and no longer gritty, 30–35 minutes. Remove from heat and add Parmesan, butter, and salt.

Absolutely I would make this recipe again. I cut recipe to 2/3 and cooked as per instruction but only salted to taste and it was perfect. One of the best recipes I’ve ever made. ,17,15.470588235294118,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0

"For a first timer, this turned out terribly. Ingredients shows 3c of milk. Directions say to bring milk and 3c of water to boil. Thought “this sure is a lot of liquid,” but figured I’d just stick to the directions....to my ruin. Next time, no water > is adding water a mistake in the directions(?) And I’ll start with 2c milk adding as it thickens. I'll try again. ",33,49.484848484848484,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0

"As many others did, I cut this recipe in half, but didn't have any whole milk or cream so I used two cups or partly skimmed milk with one cup of water, and kept the cheese and butter portions up and it turned out really good. Was my wife's first time eating creamy polenta but it will not be the last as it was very well received. Good recipe.",33,20.21212121212121,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0

"OK, time for the review. I made this for myself, so I halved the recipe. I used all whole milk (3 cups), 2 TBS butter, and 1/2 tsp of salt - and it was great! Creamy and cheesy and perfect with a pork chop and steamed broccoli. I've definitely added this recipe to my repertoire - thanks!",27,12.777777777777779,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0

"Sorry, but this isn't a review. It's more of a question that I wont get answered before I make a first attempt at the recipe. From reading the comments, the salt in the original recipe is an issue - and I can understand with the 4tsp called-for. My question is whether the milk should be diluted 50% with water; I couldn't tell from the reviews whether people thought the dilution produced the right consistency or not. SO - knowing I wont get an answer to this before supper is due: I intend to make a half recipe with only whole milk (2C) and 1/2tsp (or more) of salt. PLEASE: I'm curious to know whether you folks liked the 50% dilution, but even if no one replies, I'll post my review of my version.",57,12.824561403508772,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0

"I was worried by the negative comments, but the polenta came together beautifully for me! Admittedly I only had no whole milk, but I used 2 1/2 cups of semi skimmed milk, and 1/2 cup of heavy cream, to be as close to the richness of whole milk as possible. I would say to taste the polenta after each teaspoon of salt, as I found 1 teaspoon was enough. Its really tasty! Akin to creamy cheesy mashed potato, I could eat it straight with a spoon",43,12.023255813953488,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0

"Pitta is a typical Easter dish in Calabria and is typically eaten the same day it is made. Pitta is perfect for picnics as a slice can be held easily in one hand.The flavour is a bit like a Calabrian croque madame with its salty prosciutto and salami, creamy mozzarella and nutritious egg encased in a crisp bread shell.

"It is said that the pitta was made as a way to test the temperature of the wood ovens. Pitta has many variations and can be stuffed with combinations such as tinned tuna, tomatoes, green olives, onions and oregano; cooked aubergine/eggplant, spicy fennel sausage, scamorza and tomato; black olives, anchovies, salami and Tropea onion; or aubergine, garlic, chillies, tomatoes, mozzarella and basil.",38,5.342105263157895,9.5,14.0,5.1875,0.0,8.8,0.0,0,0,0,0,0

"Alessandro Gavagna's innovative crunchy polenta dish makes a beautiful vegetarian starter recipe during the spring and summer months. With layers of crisp polenta, creamy asparagus sauce and vibrant pea purée, this verdant savoury mille-feuille showcases some truly stunning seasonal ingredients. The polenta and asparagus can be cooked on a grill but, if you are planning an al fresco feast, would work equally well cooked on a barbecue.",43,9.534883720930232,0,198.0,0,0.0,5.5,9.0,0,0,0,0,0

Sourdough starter is acidic. Acidic ingredients tenderize gluten. Sourdough discard helps keep this pie crust tender. No one likes a tough pie crust.,18,6.277777777777778,5.25,7.333333333333333,17.27777777777778,23.625,15.083333333333334,53.666666666666664,0,0,0,0,0
As the crust bakes there is a tiny bit of lift from the natural yeast in the sourdough starter. I find that lift helps make the crust even flakier as the air pockets in the dough poof up a bit and separate the layers of dough.,24,23.625,7.333333333333333,17.27777777777778,6.277777777777778,15.083333333333334,53.666666666666664,40.01273885350319,0,0,0,0,0

"Any suggestions for doing this with a wheat-free discard?

"It was extra crumbly so I added more water (not sure how much, a few splashes until it seemed good). I did have to mix it more though because I didn’t realize how crumbly until after I took it out of the fridge. And I had run out of shortening which is hard to get here (in the UK) so used more butter. Daughter had a taste as I was transferring her mini pies to another container and she said it was good, so it probably turned out fine. In future, I will just add some more water at the start.

"As we enter into late summer, it’s once again the traditional time of year for putting up the season’s bountiful vegetables for enjoyment in the colder weather months. Some vegetables, like tomatoes, take to straight up canning. They are briefly cooked, either peeled and left whole (for pelati ) or milled (for passata ) before being sealed in mason jars. Other vegetables can be prepared sott’aceto , literally “under vinegar” aka pickled, as in the much loved antipasto known as gardiniera.

"First off, to salt or not to salt? These days most eggplants don’t really need salting to remove their bitterness, as they used to tell you in the old days. But salting is still helpful for preserving eggplant sott’olio , in my opinion, as it helps soften the eggplant to better absorb its flavorings. And, of course, the salt itself seasons the eggplant. But if you want to skip this step, increase the parboil time to 3-5 minutes. And you’ll be in fine company; none other than my muse Jeanne Caròla Francesconi doesn’t salt her melanzane sott’olio.

"Late to this, but my beloved Italian ex-mother-in-law grated her eggplant and it had the most superb texture – better even than slicing, in my opinion.

"Frank, I just came across your blog today through Feedspot (I follow Italian cooking blogs off and on). I completely related to your stories, and the recipe for melanzone sott’ olio transported me back to my paternal grandmother’s kitchen (Siciian) and my mother’s kitchen (her family was Abruzzese). This was one of my many “favorite” dishes growing up and I haven’t made it in several years. This is very similar to how my mother made it, but better I think! I am a doctor by day, and a cook by night. Growing my food in my own garden (or getting from a local farmer) and cooking, both bring me great peace. Thanks for sharing your recipes and stories! Both of my kids are foodies and cooks (my son may even be better than me…..) and I will be turning them on to your blog. Thanks again!",67,4.104477611940299,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0

"a melanzane sott’ olio recipe. This antipasto is one of my absolute favorites and unfortunately my grandma never wrote down her recipe of it . I am a big gardener as was she and the last few years I have tried to make melanzane sott’ olio with my eggplants and found it extremely difficult to find recipes that included the different ways of preparations in un biased ways. My family had always canned and stored a bunch in the pantry for months, and also gave as Christmas presents. But I had found it extremely difficult to find recipes these days for that method. Most were only for short term fridge storage, and were very cautious about saying to not store long term and other things like to not use fresh herbs for danger of botulism. Then after extensive searching I found a good recipe in Italian but then it was like you can put it in any type of left over jar and tighten with your hands and store for months (which I do not think is safe). So both ends of the spectrum. However last year I just followed bits and pieces of a few different recipes and then canned them via water bath as I do for pickling and it turned out fabulous. Each year seems to get better. My family was so pleased to be able to enjoy this delicious antipasto once again. I actually dont really need a recipe for it anymore, as I was blessed with my mothers “lil this, lil’ that, lil taste” Italian way of cooking and at this point of trial and error I have gotten the gist of it enough to make it my own. But I do check back in every year online to see if any better recipes have been posted and long story long, you have posted the BEST one I have yet to see. So thank you, and if anyone else has read this far, MAKE THIS DISH! You will not regret it, it never fails to satisfy friends and family, even if they dont like eggplants! Its good on EVERYTHING!",169,7.372781065088757,0.0,0,1.375,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0

"What a fun idea, Frank! Years ago, I learned about marinating artichokes in olive oil, and that was a huge hit. The artichokes themselves were delicious, and the artichoke-infused olive oil was excellent on salads and in other recipes. However, I’ve never done this with eggplant! This post has totally inspired me. I wonder if you could do a combination of artichoke and eggplant in same jar?",32,14.9375,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0

What a great way to preserve the flavours of summer; I can just imagine how beautifully the flavours take you right back to the warmth and sunshine in the middle of a blustery cold day. It’s just the two of us so I don’t can much but I am interested in this. Won’t refrigerating make the oil coagulate?

Gotta get eggplants, of course, but this is the time of year when they really shine. Thanks for the discussion about salt.

Polenta in my country is called sadza or pap. We make it so that it’s solid enough to hold as a ball in your hands. I like experimenting with it as well. Maybe one day you might try the version you can eat with your hands.,21,13.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0

"OMG, you are amazing! I was so excited to stumble upon your blog that I spent three hours reading and copying your recipes to my tablet and then, of course, subscribed. I’ve been a vegetarian for over 30 years and am always looking for new foods to try and inspiring ways to prepare them. I’m retired and spend a significant amount of time reading vegetarian and vegan blogs, and I have never been so Inspired!!! I know I’ll be having lots of fun and inventive yummy meals for months. I counted how many recipes I copied so far that I feel I must try, and I came up with 48! I started with this polenta dish because I had all the ingredients in house, also because it’s been a favorite food since childhood. My family of Italian ladies, who could make you swoon over the simplest preparations, used to make what they called mush. They would cover a dinner plate with the soft polenta, top it with a long-simmered marinara and freshly grated aged cheeses imported from Italy. When one of the ladies made mush, word spread and we would all descend on her kitchen to slurp and laugh, very fond memories. I didn’t mean to write a novel, sorry. One brief mention. I only had coarse ground polenta, Bob’s Red Mill, and it was still creamy and smooth. I recently followed their instructions for making it in the slow cooker with vegetable broth, literally add to cooker, set and forget, no stirring, and it was perfect. Well, time to peruse which Bianca creation to make for tonight’s dinner. Thank you for these treasures and for the artistry with which they’re presented.",141,11.212765957446809,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0

I’ve only ever seen polenta in the cold vegan/vegetarian section at my grocery store. It comes in a tube of about 16 oz. i believe it is usually sliced and fried to make polenta cakes. Is this the same polenta you used in your recipe?,20,11.5,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0

"When I take cornmeal from my pantry to make cakes or cookies, I hear my mom’s voice in my head: “Don’t forget to add fennel to help with the digestion.” When my children were babies, she taught me to make fennel seed tea “chá de erva-doce” and give them a few teaspoons at time if they had colic, so we always have it in our pantry. It is a flavor I crave and love. It is a staple on corn baked goods I grew up eating in Brazil. You may leave the fennel out or substitute for spices that you like.

"Here is a fruity gluten-free cake that is perfect for the summer months. Baking gluten-free cakes is worth trying and doesn’t require any special skills. It is just like any other baking, but without standard wheat flour. There are plenty of alternative flours that are now commonly used in baking, such as rice flour and coconut flour. But, by using ground almonds instead of flour, you’ll soon become quite confident, not to mention popular with all the luxuriously moist, light and tasty cakes you can make.",45,18.133333333333333,0.0,14.333333333333334,14.333333333333334,5.935483870967742,13.131578947368421,16.166666666666668,0,0,0,0,0
"Claudia Roden is acclaimed for her gluten-free orange and almond cake which first appeared in her _Book of Middle Eastern Food_ , in 1968. The best ones have an intensely fruity dimension, such as a tangy citrus syrup, a Mediterranean twist or Middle Eastern warmth. Many of the most popular gluten-free cakes contain polenta, which is made from corn, so it is naturally gluten-free.",31,5.935483870967742,14.333333333333334,14.333333333333334,18.133333333333333,13.131578947368421,16.166666666666668,24.25,0,0,0,0,0
"When you can buy punnets of succulently ripe peaches this polenta cake is very tasty, and stunning when decorated with a glazed layer of fruit over the top. Adding polenta to the cake gives a firm structure and a distinctive mealy texture. Use fine polenta (also known as quick-cook or instant polenta) rather than coarse polenta. Best of all the polenta imparts a gorgeous burnt-yellow hue.",38,13.131578947368421,14.333333333333334,18.133333333333333,5.935483870967742,16.166666666666668,24.25,6.5,0,0,0,0,0

"There is lots of moist richness with melted butter, but you can also use sunflower oil. The orange syrup gives it just the right amount of sweetness, and this is where you might like to add a dash of liqueur, such as peach schnapps, if you would like to serve it as a delicious dessert. Glazing the fruit once baked with a brush of warm apricot jam will keep it looking vibrant if you want to keep it for a few days (you can also use redcurrant jelly). Decorate this cake in your own style with blanched, toasted, flaked almonds or chopped pistachio nuts. Serve it chilled with thickly whipped cream, yogurt, mascarpone or creme fraiche. If you have a muffin tray, take this recipe and easily turn it into a tray of gluten-free muffins for the beach or a picnic.",73,16.904109589041095,16.166666666666668,24.25,6.5,28.666666666666668,0,29.0,0,0,0,0,0

It seems I’ve been experimenting with vegan upside-down cakes here for quite a while. This vegan upside-down fig cake was maybe my first upside-down cake.,11,12.0,16.25,12.333333333333334,15.0,10.807692307692308,12.24,9.857142857142858,0,0,0,0,0
"Since that cake, there were quite a few upside-down cakes baked! When one of your kids has a dairy intolerance you have to experiment with different non-dairy milks. My other kid is always the first to notice when it’s vegan margarine and not butter, but this cake was one that he approved of. I already shared the dairy and egg version of this cake.",26,10.807692307692308,12.333333333333334,15.0,12.0,12.24,9.857142857142858,7.625,0,0,0,0,0
"If you’re already onto fall recipes, you have to try the apple version of this cake (just sub peaches with apples to make it vegan like this one). But to stick with totally vegan inspiration, you have to try this pineapple upside-down cake.

It is so easy to put together and another moist and delicious dairy-free cake idea! It’s been baked for quite a few parties at the last minute. Everyone always loves it (even the non-vegans)and goes great with a scoop of ice-cream (dairy-free for the vegans).,21,9.857142857142858,12.0,10.807692307692308,12.24,7.625,14.166666666666666,2.380952380952381,0,0,0,0,0
I even made it in Italy for my in-laws and it was loved by all. There is nothing like having your uncle arrive from Verona with 40 lbs of fresh peaches from his brother-in-law’s peach farm. Things like that only happen to us when we are in Italy. There were peaches in every bowl and on the balcony in cases.,24,7.625,10.807692307692308,12.24,9.857142857142858,14.166666666666666,2.380952380952381,3.75,0,0,0,0,0

"My mother-in-law had my father-in-law whisk a case or two down to the cantina. My sister-in-law brought a huge bag to her house one Sunday when they were visiting.

"Panade is the French country cook's answer to stuffing — a satisfying and efficient way to use up stale bread. Because there are so few components, taking care to ensure that each one is just right will make all the difference in how the final dish tastes. Start with a stale, crusty loaf of sourdough bread. Cook the onions slowly, until they're a deep caramel color, and then season them properly with vinegar and wine. Buy good Gruyère and Parmesan, and grate it yourself. And finally, use either homemade chicken stock, or buy some from a butcher.

"This pie owes its heritage to the isolated and rural Italian island of Sardinia where simple, homely dishes are often cooked. You can also make smaller, individual pies and bake them for about 50 minutes instead. The hot-water pastry is lovely and flavoursome and will lift your pie to great heights. If you can’t find duck or goose fat, use 100 g lard with the butter, instead, and the result is nearly as good.",40,13.425,0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0,5.0,0,0,0,0,0

"Today I want to share with you the recipe of a very ancient dish: Sa Panada. And when I say “ancient” I mean it, as it appears that it was already known more than 2000 years ago! The name panada literally means “ball” and it is a traditional pie from the region of Sardegna (Sardinia), which is this week’s choice for my Regional Italian dishes series. It was traditionally made with eels, while now you also find panadas with other types of filling. Today I will share with you the recipe for a panada filled with lamb and potatoes, which is another typical filling as Sardegna is famous for lamb and sheep products (especially sheep milk cheeses). It is delicious and I think it also makes a great picnic meal! Enjoy!",67,6.985074626865671,17.0,0.0,17.0,16.5,14.0,19.75,0,0,0,0,0

"Today I want to share with you the recipe of a very ancient dish: _Sa Panada_. And when I say “ancient” I mean it, as it appears that it was already known more than 2000 years ago! The name _panada_ literally means “ball” and it is a traditional pie from the region of Sardegna (Sardinia), which is this week’s choice for my Regional Italian dishes series. It was traditionally made with eels, while now you also find _panadas_ with other types of filling. Today I will share with you the recipe for a _panada_ filled with lamb and potatoes, which is another typical filling as Sardegna is famous for lamb and sheep products (especially sheep milk cheeses). It is delicious and I think it also makes a great picnic meal! Enjoy!",62,6.032258064516129,17.0,0.0,17.0,16.5,14.0,19.75,0,0,0,0,0

I believe this dish was first introduced by either Portuguese or Spanish traders who came to Indonesia for spices around the 15th century. Since the East Indonesians love their fish and spices, they fill their pastry with fish and many other spices to suit their palate.",31,5.741935483870968,15.0,0,0,14.279069767441861,2.0384615384615383,30.0,0,0,0,0,0
"If you follow my previous post, cakalang pampis – skipjack tuna floss is the filling for this pastry. However, a friend of mine, Ellen loves to add shredded green papaya to her panada to make the filling not too dry. My first made of panada, I stuffed only with cakalang pampis and found a bit drier the inside. Then, I added with shredded green papaya to cakalang pampis and found that she is right; the filling is moister.",43,14.279069767441861,0,0,5.741935483870968,2.0384615384615383,30.0,0.6666666666666666,0,0,0,0,0

"The first step in preparing panada is to make the violada dough : mix whole wheat semolina flour and lard in a bowl. After a few minutes, add the salted lukewarm water. Knead the dough extensively until you obtain a smooth, firm compound, which you will shape into a ball, wrap in film and leave in the fridge to rest for at least one hour.",35,52.285714285714285,0,2.0,191.0,191.0,17.77777777777778,191.0,0,0,0,0,1

"In the meantime, prepare the ingredients for the filling : peel and wash the potatoes, then chop them into large pieces. Dice the lamb and the pecorino. Finely mince the parsley, garlic and sun-dried tomatoes.",18,17.77777777777778,191.0,52.285714285714285,191.0,191.0,26.757575757575758,191.0,0,0,0,0,1

"After one hour, take the dough out of the fridge and divide it into two pieces: a larger one that will form the base of your panada, and a smaller one, around 1/3 of the size of the first, which will be the lid. Roll out the bigger piece until you obtain a circular sheet of pastry , 5mm thick and 36 cm in diameter. Place this in a round flare-lip baking dish greased with butter, then start to fill it.",33,26.757575757575758,191.0,17.77777777777778,191.0,191.0,31.955555555555556,191.0,0,0,0,0,1

"Start by creating a layer with the minced parsley, garlic and sun-dried tomatoes, then one layer with diced potatoes and another with pecorino. Add a little olive oil and continue with a layer of lamb meat. You may wish to add a little salt, but be careful not to overdo this since pecorino and lamb meat are already very salty. Build three more layers with the potatoes, pecorino cheese, lamb and the remaining chopped seasoning and fold the edges of your panada.",45,31.955555555555556,191.0,26.757575757575758,191.0,191.0,36.57142857142857,0,0,0,0,0,1

"Roll out the second piece of dough until you get a disc that is big enough to cover the filling but smaller than the baking dish. Place it on top of your panada and press with your fingers to create the typical crease, and attach the edges of the lid to the edges of the ‘basket’. Brush with egg yolk. Pre-heat the oven to 200° and bake your panada for 30 minutes ; then turn the temperature down to 180° and let it cook for another hour. Once ready, remove your panada from the oven and let it cool a little before serving. Enjoy your meal!",49,36.57142857142857,191.0,31.955555555555556,191.0,0,4.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,1

"Today's recipe comes from an island, but not from Sicily: Panada is the Sardinian artichokes. the Panada, in Sardinian “pANADA” It is a typical recipe of Assemini, in Sardegna. A town near Cagliari is famous for Panada, both for the manufacture of ceramics (you have already read my article on CERAMIC SARDA OF WALTER USAI?).",29,7.310344827586207,1.0,32.0,4.25,16.0,8.971830985915492,14.409638554216867,0,0,0,0,0

"The panada according to the traditional recipe consists of a treasure trove of 'pasta violada', only prepared with water, durum wheat semolina and lard, and a meat stuffing (especially lamb) or eel. At the meat and eel you can be combined with different vegetables like artichokes, dried tomatoes, potatoes, the peas. There is also a version with an entirely vegetarian stuffing, made with mixed vegetables or, as in my case, artichokes and potatoes. I've also added some diced soft Sardinian pecorino Dolce, which in my opinion makes the panada even more delicious Sardinian artichokes. But they left the line of tradition. Obviously I recommend you take a look at all my SARDINIAN RECIPES (I'm a whole lot’ saw that my partner is Sardinian) and all my RECIPES WITH ARTICHOKES.",71,8.971830985915492,4.25,7.310344827586207,16.0,14.409638554216867,4.25,4.25,0,0,0,0,0
"I know it will seem strange, but both the potatoes is the artichokes are put inside the raw panada, well seasoned with garlic, oil, parsley. This is because in an hour of cooking pasta bake perfectly inside the casket. Is’ important to drill a hole in the center of the Panada, so that the steam that will emanate in cooking can escape. Otherwise you will find when you open a sort of 'broth’ unpleasant. The perfect Panada is golden, well done, with a crunchy crust and a filling (of meat, fish or vegetables) tender and flavorful. I assure you that the Sardinian panada artichoke is a wonderful dish, perfect for your EASTER LUNCH OR MONDAY. You can prepare quietly vegan version replacing lard with olive oil (find the doses of ingredients) and not putting cheese. Is, if you have to prepare something for a picnic or buffet, do not forget to take inspiration from all my RECIPES AND QUICHE QUICHES.

I get very confused about phyllo dough. The package I bought is 16 oz and says it has 36 sheets. So I should be using all 36 in this recipe? It just seems excessive but I also want to make it correctly. Thanks!,18,22.444444444444443,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0

"It was just ok. It came out very dry, but that might be partly my fault - I'm new to phyllo dough, so I might not have put enough oil on it. But the flavor was just ""ok."" I even used feta ""with Mediterranean spices"" and a bit of nutmeg. It definitely needed more spices/flavor. Next time I'll try adding a bit more nutmeg and maybe an additional spice blend. But it's a great ""starter"" recipe. Thanks! 🙂",36,17.833333333333332,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0

"My husband can't eat tomatoes so I came up with this so we could have Italian once in a while! Serve over cooked pasta or use instead of canned tomatoes or sauce in any recipe - just change the spices! I now use this as a base for chili, goulash and pizza too!

Make sure to use the red wine vinegar to match the acidity of the tomatoes. I am now going to research no-tomato ketchup recipes. Read More",35,7.457142857142857,0.0,0.0,0,1.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0

The next time I made it I added in some roasted red bell pepper (from the jar, blended), a little vegetable broth, and pepper. This made it more saucy and tasty!

"I can't eat red tomatoes and have been looking for alternatives to Alfredo and pesto sauce for quite a while. I really liked this recipe. It mimicked ""red"" sauce so well, I had to train my brain that it was ok to eat :) it came out a little too thick, but I think that was because I used fresh carrots instead of canned.

"I was diagnosed with a tomato allergy a few years ago and have missed my homemade lasagna so SO bad. This sauce was the first time I've had good lasagna in years!! If you have a tomato allergy, this recipe is life changing :) To me, it just tastes like a low-acid tomato sauce. My husband complained loudly about how he'll hate the sauce because he can't stand beets. But after he tried it, he's been more than willing to go for seconds. He admits that you can't taste the beets. My only suggestion is adding a few tablespoons of chicken broth and plenty of oregano and basil. The sauce takes on the seasonings very well. THANK YOU!!

"I absolutely LOVE Italian & Mexican foods, but something in the tomato causes swelling in my feet & ankles. I have had this recipe for quite a while, & I finally got around to using it this past Sunday to go over my meatloaf, and BOY-OH-BOY-OH-BOY!! Am I ever glad I did! I didn't have a bay leaf, so I added a little more Italian Seasoning, tweaked my seasonings (a pinch of sugar, a dash of hot sauce, & a splash of Sweet Chili sauce)...it made quite a bit (enough so that turned around & used the leftovers & made spaghetti for the next nite!) I will most DEFINITELY be tweaking the Italian Seasonings & using my favorite Mexican seasonings (chili powder, cumin, & Adobe) to make some homemade chili within the next few weeks! I did take a picture of the meatloaf when it was done..at work right now, so I will upload it later! Read More",79,8.734177215189874,0.0,0.0,0,1.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0

"I tried this last night and used fresh beets & carrots (not canned). It worked like a charm to boil the veggies, blend then and by adding a bit of the carrot water back into the blended veggies, it created a beautiful sauce. THANK YOU for sharing this recipe!

"Wow! After receiving sticker-shock at the price of the no-tomato sauce in my local whole food store, I went in search of a recipe I could do myself. I am pleasantly surprised at how deceiving this is! My youngest son has a tomato sensitivity and this is a great substitute. Make sure to use the red wine vinegar to match the acidity of the tomatoes. I am now going to research no-tomato ketchup recipes. ",34,7.676470588235294,0.0,0.0,0,1.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0

I can tell that there are other veggies in the sauce, but I couldn't tell you that there weren't tomatoes in it. I'm going to start adding this in with my regular tomato based sauce just to get more veggies into the mix. Yum! ",30,10.366666666666667,0.0,0.0,0,1.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0

"I was really excited to find this recipe since my girlfriend is allergic to tomatoes. The first time I made it, it was a little more pasty than saucy. The next time I made it I added in some roasted red bell pepper (from the jar, blended), a little vegetable broth, and pepper. This made it more saucy and tasty!

"I can't eat red tomatoes and have been looking for alternatives to Alfredo and pesto sauce for quite a while. I really liked this recipe. It mimicked ""red"" sauce so well, I had to train my brain that it was ok to eat :) it came out a little too thick, but I think that was because I used fresh carrots instead of canned. My husband (the anti-vegetarian) and my picky teen even tried it and liked it. ",36,8.0,0.0,0.0,0,1.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0

"I was diagnosed with a tomato allergy a few years ago and have missed my homemade lasagna so SO bad. This sauce was the first time I've had good lasagna in years!! If you have a tomato allergy, this recipe is life changing :) To me, it just tastes like a low-acid tomato sauce. My husband complained loudly about how he'll hate the sauce because he can't stand beets. But after he tried it, he's been more than willing to go for seconds. He admits that you can't taste the beets. My only suggestion is adding a few tablespoons of chicken broth and plenty of oregano and basil. The sauce takes on the seasonings very well. THANK YOU!!

"I absolutely LOVE Italian & Mexican foods, but something in the tomato causes swelling in my feet & ankles. I have had this recipe for quite a while, & I finally got around to using it this past Sunday to go over my meatloaf, and BOY-OH-BOY-OH-BOY!! Am I ever glad I did! I didn't have a bay leaf, so I added a little more Italian Seasoning, tweaked my seasonings (a pinch of sugar, a dash of hot sauce, & a splash of Sweet Chili sauce)...it made quite a bit (enough so that turned around & used the leftovers & made spaghetti for the next nite!) I will most DEFINITELY be tweaking the Italian Seasonings & using my favorite Mexican seasonings (chili powder, cumin, & Adobe) to make some homemade chili within the next few weeks! I did take a picture of the meatloaf when it was done..at work right now, so I will upload it later! ",78,8.846153846153847,0.0,0.0,0,1.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0

"Made this and it was awesome! I made it into tacos which was great. I didn’t have eggplant and wanted to use what I had so I made the tahini sauce exactly the same way just without the eggplant and it was still very good. We had it for lunch but my husband said he could easily see eating this for breakfast. If I was gunna make this for breakfast I think I would want to add some meatless sausage or something but it was great without it too! Highly recommend! Keep in mind though it definitely doesn’t taste like eggs, which is fine for us but anyone new to eating vegan/vegetarian etc may think it’s an egg substitute and it’s not, it’s its own thing.",57,11.017543859649123,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0

This was just the creative take I needed on a “scramble” to make a fun and nourishing breakfast with the ingredients I had on hand (I used store-bought baba ganoush that was leftover from a meal earlier in the week).

"Made this with sides of couscous + frozen peas, and crispy hash potatoes with cumin, turmeric, slightly too much cayenne, and ginger. It was DELICIOUS and incredibly filling. Omitted the eggplant because I didn’t have one, but otherwise made the chickpea “eggs” with everything else that would have gone in it (the tahini lemon juice mixture). Put it on high heat in a cast iron and then threw in some BREAD CRUMBS which made it even crispier and gave it a flaky/crispy texture. Heartiest breakfast in a while. Will be making again.

"This is one of the most delicious things I’ve ever had for breakfast! I made a tahini-free babaganoush because my daughter is allergic to sesame. I roasted 2 large eggplants in the oven at 400 degrees for around an hour, let them cool, scooped out the insides, put in food processor with 2 cloves of garlic and the juice of one lemon and then processed for about 15 seconds. Other than that I followed the recipe exactly and found the spice mixture to be perfectly balanced flavor-wise. I served it on top of hashbrowns.

"Traditionally from Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, Ecuador and Peru, _humitas_ is a dish of pre-Columbian origin prepared with corn, tomatoes and cheese.",12,6.166666666666667,0.0,0.6666666666666666,2.0,2.0,0.7857142857142857,1.5862068965517242,0,0,0,0,0
Where does the word humitas come from?,3,2.0,0.6666666666666666,2.0,6.166666666666667,0.7857142857142857,1.5862068965517242,0.0,0,0,0,0,0
"The noun “humita” is derived from the word “huminta”, which comes from the Quechua word _humint’a_. In Corrientes, an Argentinian province, it is known as “mbutacá”, a Guarani expression.",14,0.7857142857142857,2.0,6.166666666666667,2.0,1.5862068965517242,0.0,0.3333333333333333,0,0,0,0,0
In Paraguay it carries the Guarani name of “ka’i ku’a” whose translation into Spanish is “monkey waist”. It received this name because the way of tying the humitas resembles a form similar to the waist of the monkeys. It is a very traditional dish in some Paraguayan towns as it was widely consumed by the Guarani Indians.,29,1.5862068965517242,6.166666666666667,2.0,0.7857142857142857,0.0,0.3333333333333333,0.0,0,0,0,0,0

"I found this peach cobbler recipe on the internet from the Salt Lick Restaurant in Austin, TX. Everyone loves this recipe so much I have to make a double batch! Feel free to cut back on the sugar. Everyone has and the peach cobbler still comes out perfect. :D Personally, I always use two bags of frozen peaches instead of canned.",36,12.25,0,0,10.666666666666666,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0

"Johor royal family member shares signature cempedak kek lapis. Born in Johor, Balkis and her family are members of the Johor royal family who moved to the Klang Valley in the 1970s.

"Although Balkis sticks to simple striped layers for her kek lapis, her flavour range is where she really experiments, with kek lapis variants that include chocolate, Nutella and even durian!

"In truth, plokkfiskur isn’t quiet a stew, at least not by modern standards. It’s a rich dish, with butter and cream similar to fish chowder, but the sauce is thick so that plokkfiskur is just as at home in a bowl or served as a spread on top of thin slices of Icelandic rye bread (rúgbrauð).",27,17.296296296296298,3.0,7.7894736842105265,0.0,17.458333333333332,5.111111111111111,0.0,0,0,0,0,0
"The recipe is similar to other Icelandic food staples, in that it’s based on meat/fish and potatoes, and it’s stick to your ribs comfort food. _Kjötsúpa (Icelandic Lamb Soup)_, for example, uses lamb and skips the cream, but slow-cooked marrow bones add plenty of richness.

"_“This is an ancient dish, which exists today in many variations. In the old days, I imagine it was made from salted and dried fish or just dried fish and the connection to central European dishes, like for examplebrandade, is quite apparent. Today, plokkfiskur is mostly made from fresh cod or haddock, which is boiled specifically for the dish, or else from leftovers from another recipe. Most older recipes contain some onion and pepper as the only flavorings, but recent recipes contain things like curry powder, dijon mustard, and grated cheese — Or pretty much anything that seems fitting and delicious._",59,5.711864406779661,8.5,8.307692307692308,1.9,14.409090909090908,7.7272727272727275,0.0,0,0,0,0,0

"We first dreamt up this recipe as something resembling socca but thinner, crispier, and more foldable. Socca is a flatbread made from chickpea flour and its origin is hotly debated. Some claim it originated in the region that is now Nice, France, while others claim it was invented in Genoa, Italy (where it’s called _farinata_ ) or Marseille, France (where it’s called _panisse_ ). Still other versions can be found in Sardinia, Gibraltar, Algeria, and Argentina (source).",39,3.4615384615384617,6.675,41.63636363636363,3.0,4.117647058823529,26.0,31.583333333333332,0,0,0,0,0

Use a spatula to peek at the underside of the pancake to make sure it’s browned before flipping — the pancake should lift away from the pan easily; if it sticks, let it cook a bit longer. Once ready, flip and cook for 1 minute on the other side. If you are using cast iron and the batter is sticking, wipe a small amount of olive oil across the entire surface of the pan and try again.

"So dang yummy!! The first crepe I did was a disaster, the second one was a little better and then after that they all came out great. I used a non-stick pan, I think really the thing that solved the issue was getting the pan very hot, enough so that the batter immediately sizzled when I put it on the pan, after reaching that temperature I had no more sticking issues. The taste so was delicious and savory, definitely will be making again soon!",36,14.36111111111111,0.6666666666666666,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0

"So before I started to make this recipe, I read all of the comments below. Like everyone else, the shiitake mushroom and leek mix turned out great, no issue. But… I tried the chickpea batter and I couldn’t get the thin crepe like consistency when I followed the recipe. Instead, it was pretty thick. I didn’t have any clumps and after 15 minutes, the batter was even thicker. I had to add more water to make the consistency as described. And it was a lot more water than found in the recipe. When I put the batter in a non stick pan, in medium heat, it looked okay. But when I tried to flip it, it started to break apart. I waited patiently before I flipped it, but each time it was broken into bits… The batter wasn’t too thin, so I couldn’t understand how the recipe would have worked for others. Needless to say, our family didn’t have the chickpea pancake for lunch, it was chickpea pancake bits…. From my experience, chickpea flour alone doesn’t hold very well… so it’s often mixed with another flour or arrowroot starch. Did anyone else have the same experience? @MinimalistBaker – can you share the brand of chickpea flour used and confirm if it was 100% chickpea flour?",99,20.727272727272727,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0

"Oh no! We’re so sorry to hear that was your experience! It sounds like it may have had too much water as that can lead to cracking and breaking.

"This is the second time I made this recipe and I did use nutritional yeast this time rather than grilled chicken. It was delicious. Making the pancakes the second time around was a lot easier and I did 2 frypans at a time. I’m now curious what kind of variety I can come up with for fillings given health/dietary considerations.

"My new go-to for lunch – soooo good. This dish actually made me enjoy mushrooms (I used portobello).

"Absolutely delicious and will definitely make again. Followed the ingredients portions and got enough for two entrees. Even after 15 minutes, I was skeptical about the thickness of the batter. Decided to just go for it and it turned out lovely. I used a nonstick pan without oil and it flipped fine. Edits included salting mushrooms after cooking rather than before to reduce liquid pulled from them, topped stack of pancakes with a thin layer of spero sunflower vegan cream cheese. Finished with chives and a little truffle salt. Delicious and easy!",52,17.51923076923077,0.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,0,0,0,0,0

"We made this recipe exactly as written except we doubled the amount of topping and ate the pancakes flat instead of folded over. This was maximum flavor for minimum effort! Very easy to make. I love the toasty, nutty flavor of the chickpea pancake. Shiitake mushrooms are definitely the way to go because given the minimal number of ingredients it really provides a lot more flavor.

"We’re so sorry this one gave you trouble, Vicky! A few ideas here- 1) The batter may have been too thick, in which case we’re thinking maybe brands of chickpea flour vary? What brand did you use? 2) The pan may have been too hot, not allowing them to spread. And 3) We did have the most success with a non-stick pan versus a cast iron skillet.

"Vicky, we did some more experimenting with a cast iron and it is more finicky, but does work! We were able to replicate your issue with it cracking and found that it was because the heat was too low and so it didn’t cook fast enough and started drying out. Since a non-stick changes temperature more quickly than a cast iron, it’s easier to use. Hope that’s helpful!",28,12.428571428571429,0.0,0.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0

I make chickpea pancakes all the time my kids love them. I like to use veggie broth instead of water for added flavor. I use plant-mylk to make a sweet version of chickpea pancakes and also add some vanilla and a splash of maple syrup to the batter then fill them with berry compote and a drizzle of almond or cashew butter.,34,24.823529411764707,0.0,0.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,0,0,0,0,0

"Paximadia -- rusks -- have a long and storied history in Greece. Paximadia more or less as we know them today derive from the ancient Greek dipyros, which means twice-baked, essentially a savory biscuit. The rusks are called paximadia after a Byzantine monk named Paximus, who improved on the ancient recipe leaving a legacy that to this day is a living tradition. Rusks are made all over Greece and come in all manner of shapes and sizes; the dough can be made from wheat, rye, barley, corn, carob and chickpea flour, or from various combinations thereof. The following recipes is from a home baker in the town of Enagron, a mountain village between Rethymnon and Irakleion. Crete, perhaps more than anywhere else in Greece, is renowned for the variety of paximadia, both sweet and savory, traditionally made on the island.

"3. Dilute the starter in the well with about a third of the lukewarm water. Add sugar on top of starter (sugar will help the starter work better). Add 1 cup olive oil and and sprinkle the salt around the rim of the flour. Add a cup or two more of the water and start gradually kneading to form a dense dough mass that doesn’t stick. Local bread bakers, toward the end of the kneading process, dampen their hands with water, thus adding a little more moisture to the dough without adding so much that the dough will be sticky.",55,50.945454545454545,323.0,45.6,40.22222222222222,44.541666666666664,31.57894736842105,23.59090909090909,0,0,0,1,1

5. Shape the dough into into loaves about 3 inches wide and as long as your baking sheets can hold. Score the slices almost but not all the way to the bottom. This will help you separate the slices when the dough is baked.,19,31.57894736842105,40.22222222222222,50.945454545454545,44.541666666666664,23.59090909090909,62.375,28.076923076923077,0,0,0,1,1

"some important tips and suggestion for a perfect and yummy gobhi ka paratha recipe. firstly, the dough needs to be kneaded very smoothly so that the spiced cauliflower is easily stuffed. secondly, and more importantly, apply butter or ghee on paratha while frying after you have roasted the paratha once. this ensures the paratha to cook perfectly otherwise it will turn oily and half cooked. lastly, i have added red chilli powder to gobi stuffing, but additionally green chillies too can be added to make it more spicy.",49,17.53061224489796,25.931818181818183,10.857142857142858,18.333333333333332,9.868421052631579,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0

"parotta recipe | kerala paratha recipe | malabar paratha recipe with step by step photo and video recipe. generally, south indian recipes are known for the rice or lentil-based dishes which are natively produced and used. wheat or plain flour-based flatbreads are less common with many south indians. yet there are some variations of flatbreads and are served for morning breakfast. one of the most common bread recipes is the layered parotta recipe known for its flaky texture.",46,16.02173913043478,29.0,128.0,4.0,4.983870967741935,25.666666666666668,11.180555555555555,0,0,0,0,0
"to be honest, i am not a huge fan of plain flour-based recipes or snacks made out of maida. yet i have a special obsession with the layered parotta recipe. it could be for the fact that malabar paratha is the only bread popularly consumed in south india. while i was doing my college, i did not have exposure to the exotic punjabi or north indian parathas. i had just one option, and i was happy with it. even today, i love the combination of spicy kurma with a flaky and layered parotta. even though these days i personally do not take the effort of making these parathas from scratch and i get frozen from my local grocery shop. also, i get the wheat-based ones and i prefer those for my day to day use.",62,4.983870967741935,128.0,4.0,16.02173913043478,25.666666666666668,11.180555555555555,17.91111111111111,0,0,0,0,0

"furthermore, i would like to conclude by adding some more tips, suggestions, and variations to kerala paratha recipe. firstly, the traditional parotta or also known as roti cannoi is made with plain flour or maida flour. however due to health concerns many readers prefer wheat flour. you can absolutely prepare it with wheat flour but you may not get the same flakiness and crisp. secondly, once the parathas are cooked and fried, you need to immediately crush it. otherwise, you may not get the same layers and flaky texture. lastly, try making small-sized paratha first, and do not attempt with the bigger size. you may find it difficult to deal with the gluten of maida. it would pull back to shrink in size.",72,11.180555555555555,16.02173913043478,4.983870967741935,25.666666666666668,17.91111111111111,0.0,0.5,0,0,0,0,0

"lachha paratha recipe | lachha parantha recipe with step by step photo and video recipe. lachha paratha is a popular paratha recipe prepared in ease. it is very similar to kerala paratha however, taste different. there are many ways of preparing lachha parantha in india. however, i have showed, two simple way of creating perfect layers. lachha paratha doesn’t require more oil as of kerala parota.",43,22.6046511627907,26.333333333333332,10.5,4.0,20.45098039215686,2.0,12.0,0,0,0,0,0
"initially, i use to believe that, lachha paratha and kerala paratha are same. however, they are completely different. i would say both are cousin parathas. the main difference is the flour, obliviously. while, in lachha paratha, we use 1:1 ratio of wheat and all purpose flour. where as, in malabar paratha, it is just plain flour with lot of oil. both the parathas are prepared with multi layers. perhaps it is the confusing part for most of them. also, laccha paratha is good for digestion compared to malabar paratha. because, the dough is prepared with just maida and is not good for digestion.",51,20.45098039215686,10.5,4.0,22.6046511627907,2.0,12.0,7.783783783783784,0,0,0,0,0

"however, i personally like kerala paratha compared to lachha paratha. probably, because it is more flaky, crispy and fluffy. furthermore, it is also very popularly served in many restaurants in my home town. i still remember my college days lunch hour. my college canteen use to serve amazing parathas with either veg saagu or palak paneer. also, the sugar added in the dough would give nice caramelisation and beautiful colour. moreover, those flaky layers of paratha would trap good amount of curries in each dip.",57,12.0,22.6046511627907,20.45098039215686,2.0,7.783783783783784,16.571428571428573,0.0,0,0,0,0,0

"The poorest, perhaps, of all Sard dishes, some version of mazzamurru is often a shepherd’s supper or humble sustenance for a bountyless hunter’s family. Made of whatever stuffs might be at hand, the commonalities of mazzamurru are rich ewe’s milk, some rough bread, and shards of sharp, salty cheese. The ornaments are often a handful of wild grasses or a few sun-dried tomatoes, some olives, a crush of dried herbs. Present the mazzamurru with a bowlful of some simple tomato sauce or, better, no sauce at all, its nakedness tasting of such goodness.",51,4.450980392156863,1.0,0.5,4.571428571428571,29.0,0.0,11.8,0,0,0,0,0

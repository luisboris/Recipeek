note: i've specified boneless skinless chicken thighs for this recipe; they're juicier and more flavorful than chicken breasts, and they work better in this type of yogurt and lemon-based marinade. they're also much easier to cook without drying out.it's traditionally eaten hot, but i like it cold too, once it cooled off and firmed up.
enjoy!

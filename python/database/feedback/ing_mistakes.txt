drain potatoes and pat dry.
some notes about this recipe: you can also eat the rice pudding as it is without the cream – why not have it for breakfast, with some cinnamon, sugar and milk instead!

this rice pilaf is commonly called middle eastern rice or arabic rice. it’s a standard (and possibly the most popular) side dish in that region. we typically serve it with meat dishes like kafta and shawarma, but we also use it as a base to accompany many of our stews. that’s actually how we mostly eat it in my house. it’s fluffy, nutty and versatile – basically my ultimate carb weakness!

recipe video above. this is a rice side dish that will steal the show! the rice stays fluffy and tastes quite rich, but it's not heavily flavoured (hence suitable as a side dish), yet is flavoured enough that you'll want to eat it plain. the barberries provide welcome pops of sour but don't fret if you can't find them, see note 2 for substitutions. this rice dish will pair terrifically with any persian / middle eastern / lebanese / gulf recipes. see in post for persian feast menu!

instructions
drain potatoes and pat dry.
in a large skillet cook the sugar on medium-low heat until completely melted. do not stir!
when melted and slightly darkened around the edges, add the butter and stir until it becomes kind of a syrupy mixture.
add the potatoes and a little bit of water (if the mixture starts to stiffen and form lumps turn the heat up and it will melt again).
moving the skillet around, gently cover each potato in the mixture, continuing to cook for about 6-8 minutes.

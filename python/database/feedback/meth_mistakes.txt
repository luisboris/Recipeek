brunede kartofler or caramelized browned potatoes is a delicious danish side-dish that my husband introduced me to. we have this every year with our danish christmas dinner and i love it! this brunede kartofler also goes really well with pork chops or pork tenderloin. they end up tasting kind of like a sweet potato. they have a sweet caramelized coating on every potato.
1/4 cup butter
2 tbsp. water
update: we have actually found that it is easier to add the sugar and butter in the pan at the same time (omit the water completely) and let it all melt together until the sugar dissolves and turns a deep caramel color. this way you can actually stir it without ruining it. in fact, it is best if you stir it often so it doesn’t burn. this isn’t the “authentic” way but we have found the end result is the same!

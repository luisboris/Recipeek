Instructions
1. Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F.
2. Before you begin mixing the filling, be sure the spinach is very well drained, and squeeze out any excess liquid by hand.
3. To make the filling: In a mixing bowl, add the spinach and the remaining filling ingredients. Stir until all is well-combined.
4. Unroll the phyllo (fillo) sheets and place them between two slightly damp kitchen cloths.
5. Prepare a 9 Â½" X 13" baking dish like this one. Brush the bottom and sides of the dish with olive oil.
6. To assemble the spanakopita: Line the baking dish with two sheets of phyllo (fillo) letting them cover the sides of the dish. Brush with olive oil. Add two more sheets in the same manner, and brush them with olive oil. Repeat until two-thirds of the phyllo (fillo) is used up.
7. Now, evenly spread the spinach and feta filling over the phyllo (fillo) crust. Top with two more sheets, and brush with olive oil.
8. Continue to layer the phyllo (fillo) sheets, two-at-a-time, brushing with olive oil, until you have used up all the sheets. Brush the very top layer with olive oil, and sprinkle with just a few drops of water.
9. Fold the flaps or excess from the sides, you can crumble them a little. Brush the folded sides well with olive oil. Cut Spanakopita ONLY PART-WAY through into squares, or leave the cutting to later.
10. Bake in the 325 degrees F heated-oven for 1 hour, or until the phyllo (fillo) crust is crisp and golden brown. Remove from the oven. Finish cutting into squares and serve. Enjoy!
Notes
Tips for Working with Phyllo: As mentioned earlier in the post, remember that phyllo is paper thin and will break as you are working with it. For best results, place phyllo dough sheets in between two very slightly damp kitchen towels (step 4) before you start working with it (unless you think you will work fast enough that the phyllo will not dry out.) Also, be sure to brush each layer with oil; don't skimp.
Make Ahead Tips: You can make spanakopita the evening before. Follow up to step 9, cover and refrigerate. When you are ready, go ahead and bake according to step 10.
Leftover Storing and Freezing Tips: Already cooked spanakopita will keep well if properly storied in the fridge for 2 to 3 evenings. Heat in medium-heated oven until warmed through. You can also portion cooked leftover spanakopita and freeze for a later time. Warm in oven; no need to thaw in advance.
What to Serve with Spanakopita? Spanakopita makes a great side dish for large holiday dinners next to lamb or lemon chicken. But it can easily stand alone as the main dish. Serve it with a big salad like Greek salad; Balela; or this Mediterranean chickpea salad, and favorite dips like Greek Tzatziki or Roasted Garlic Hummus.
Recommended for this Recipe:Private Reserve Greek extra virgin olive oil (from organically grown and processed Koroneiki olives).

I get very confused about phyllo dough. The package I bought is 16 oz and says it has 36 sheets. So I should be using all 36 in this recipe? It just seems excessive but I also want to make it correctly. Thanks!

Hi, Jessica. I use one 16 oz package of The Fillo Factory (size 4) pastry sheets for this recipe, which contains 20 sheets. 36 sheets does sound a bit excessive.

Sure! You can follow this general rule as far as substituting fresh dill in place of dill weed here: 3 teaspoons fresh equals 1 teaspoon dried. Happy Thanksgiving!

Perfect accompaniment to the gyro and homemade pita bread. Turned out wonderfully for my first time ever working with philo pastry.

It was just ok. It came out very dry, but that might be partly my fault - I'm new to phyllo dough, so I might not have put enough oil on it. But the flavor was just "ok." I even used feta "with Mediterranean spices" and a bit of nutmeg. It definitely needed more spices/flavor. Next time I'll try adding a bit more nutmeg and maybe an additional spice blend. But it's a great "starter" recipe. Thanks! ðŸ™‚

Could I make this a couple days ahead of time rather than just a night?

Hi, Laura. If you want to make it 2-3 days ahead, it's best to cook it first, and then store it in the fridge. When you are ready to eat it, reheat in a medium-heated oven until warmed through.

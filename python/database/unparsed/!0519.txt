vangi bath recipe, brinjal rice recipe][3]
vangi bath][4]
Vangi bath is a healthy and tasty brinjal rice dish popularly made in the Maharashtrian and Karnataka cuisine.
vangi bath recipe, brinjal rice recipe][5]![vangi bath recipe, brinjal rice recipe][6]
Both the regional recipes taste different as some of the ingredients and the spices that go into preparing them are different.
In this post, I am sharing both regional variations of making this recipe.
Vangi Bath Karnataka Style – Made with Vangi bath masala powder and tamarind pulp.
Vangi Bhath Maharashtrian Style – Made with Goda Masala and curd or tomatoes.
Both the recipes are healthy and taste good. You can make either of them as per your preference.
About Vangi Bath Karnataka Style
This is a delicious, healthy and vegan recipe of spiced brinjal rice from the Karnataka cuisine. Vangi means, brinjal, baingan, aubergines or eggplant. Bhath or bath or baath means rice.
Preparing vangi bath is very easy. All you need is to cook the rice first. Then prepare the brinjal gravy. Then mix the rice with the brinjal gravy. If you have extra cooked rice or leftover rice, then the vangi bath is quicker to prepare.
In this recipe, I have used readymade organic vangi bath masala powder from the Phalada brand. The taste of the vangi bath depends on the quality of the vangi bath masala. So do use a good quality one. You can use homemade or store brought.
Generally, green brinjals are used. But you can also use purple or purple striped brinjals. Just make sure that the brinjals are tender and fresh.
You can use any regular variety of rice like sona masuri. This is a no onion no garlic recipe. If you want, you can add onions.
Serve vangi bath with raita or plain curd. You can even pack it in the tiffin box.
How to make Vangi Bath (Karnataka Style)
1\. First, soak 1 heaped cup rice in water for 30 minutes. Use any regular rice. I used sona masuri rice.

2\. Then pressure cook the rice with 2 cups water, ¼ teaspoon salt for 3 to 4 whistles on medium flame or for 11 to 12 minutes. You can also cook the rice in a pot. If cooking in a pot, then you may need to add more water. Depending on the quality of rice, you can even cook for 2 whistles or 9 to 10 minutes.

3\. Soak ½ tablespoon tightly packed tamarind in ¼ cup hot water for 20 to 30 minutes.

4\. Later squeeze the soaked tamarind in the water to get the tamarind pulp. Strain and keep aside

5\. when the pressure settles down on its own, open the cooker’s lid and fluff the rice. You can allow the rice to cool in the cooker itself or spread rice on a large plate/thali or tray. Allow the cooked rice grains to become warm or cool down. Cover and keep so that the rice grains do not dry out. The cooked rice grains should be separate.

6\. when the rice is cooking, rinse, remove the crowns of the brinjals (vangi or baingan) and slice them vertically in 4 pieces. As soon as you chop them, place them in a bowl containing water to which some salt has been added. Do make sure that there is sufficient water covering the brinjals. Allow them to be in the salted water for 15 to 20 minutes.

About Maharashtrian Vangi Bath
This is a tasty, nutritious and popular Maharashtrian one-pot meal dish of spiced rice dish made with brinjal and freshly ground spices.
This brinjal rice recipe is prepared in the same way as a Masale bhaat or Tondli bhaat (Ivy gourd rice). Goda masala is added in these rice recipes and this spice blend gives the Maharashtrian vangi bath its unique flavor, taste and aroma.
Maharashtrian Style Vangi Bhath][37]![Maharashtrian Style Vangi Bhath][38]
In this brinjal rice recipe, I have roasted and ground the spices to prepare the goda masala, so there is no need of having a ready goda masala. If you do have goda masala powder, then skip grounding the spices.
It is a relatively easy recipe to prepare. One-pot meal which is healthy as well does not take much time if you have ready goda masala. I have cooked the rice in a kadai, but you can also cook in a pressure cooker.
I have added onions in this recipe. You can easily skip them if you don’t have onions and add a pinch of asafoetida (hing) in the tempering instead.
Serve vangi bath plain or with a side bowl of yogurt or raita.
How to make Maharashtrian Vangi Bath
1\. On a low flame in a small frying pan, dry roast the whole spices till they are aromatic.

2\. Bring the roasted spices to the side of the pan and add the desiccated coconut and sesame seeds.

5\. Once the roasted spices + coconut mixture gets cooled, grind them fine in a dry grinder or coffee grinder. Only 2 to 3 tsp of the goda masala (as per your taste) needs to be added to the rice. The remaining goda masala can be refrigerated and added to vegetable dishes or lentils.

Looks delicious.. When roasting peanuts, the flame is high or med-low? I assume they will absorb oil and get soggy if roasted at low flame
1. dassana amit says:
Dec 25, 2016 at 4:06 pm
ruchi, the flame is medium-low or medium if using a thick bottomed pan. the peanuts do not absorb oil. if the oil is cold, then the peanuts absorb oil. here we are adding peanuts once the mustard seeds crackle. mustard seeds crackle in hot oil, so in this hot temp, the peanuts get roasted well. i had used a steel pan and its gets very hot even on low flame, so i have kept the flame to a low.
1. Ruchi says:
Jan 01, 2017 at 3:01 pm
Thank you very clarifying. I’ll use this technique while making poha also then. 
Is vangi bath masala same as goda masala?
1. dassana amit says:
Jan 01, 2017 at 6:13 pm
welcome ruchi. both are different. vangi bath masala is from the karnataka cuisine. goda masala is from the maharashtra cuisine. the aroma, taste and flavor of both is totally different.
2. Ruchi says:
Jan 01, 2017 at 7:12 pm
ok. do you make this masala at home? if yes, please do share the recipe if you find time. actually this past week we made the pav bhaji masala at home using the recipe that you have shared and it was amazing! We’ve already made pav bhaji twice over the week just because it tastes so good.
3. dassana amit says:
Jan 01, 2017 at 7:28 pm
ruchi, i make goda masala at home as the quality of goda masala i get here is not at all good. there is no aroma and no flavor in them. vangi bhaat masala i have not yet tried at home. i got an organic pack of vangi bath masala and it was good. when living in bangalore also, i would buy vangi bath masala from outside. but i do plan to make one when this lot gets over. 
thanks for letting me know about the pav bhaji masala. i still have this batch and i must have made pav bhaji many times with this masala recipe. a little is still left and that will also get over soon ?

can brinjal be substituted? with potato or cucumber etc?
1. dassana amit says:
Nov 14, 2016 at 7:52 pm
you can use mix veggies like potatoes, cauliflower, carrots, beans and green peas. but just parboil them before you add in the gravy. you can also use potatoes only. with cucumber i am not sure how the texture of the veggie will be.

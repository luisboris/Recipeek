Spinach Pies – an easy vegan appetizer
Filo (aka phyllo) dough is already vegan, made with just flour, water, and a little oil and usually vinegar. It’s also easy to find and use, exactly what’s needed when you’re looking for a last minute snack or appetizer for parties.
Filled with spinach and plenty of other delicious-ness, they’re a real crowd pleaser, and extra good with a side of (vegan) tzatziki or another dipping sauce you love.

What’s in these pies?
We’ve gone for a simple Greek inspiration, with tofu feta cheese, spinach, and dill. Using frozen spinach makes things even easier and budget friendly, just thawed and with any extra water squeezed out before mixing. 
There’s also some leek, green onion, rosemary, and sesame. Plenty of flavour and texture to go around!
If you’re not vegan, you can definitely use sheep feta in place of the tofu, and it’ll cut your prep time down even further. Or try a bit of crumbled goat cheese or a store-bought vegan feta or other crumbly cheese. These are super quick and easy, but look gorgeous, just what’s needed for feeding a group.
We haven’t seen gluten-free filo pastry to buy, but there are several recipes online if you want to try making your own! Unfortunately none of us have tried them yet so we can’t recommend one in particular.

How do I make them?
First things first, get going with that tofu feta if you want to use it. The feta needs to marinate for a few hours, or overnight, so it should be made ahead. Once you’re ready to go, thaw the spinach out in the refrigerator or microwave.
Once the spinach is ready to go, most of the ingredients are sauteed in a frying pan for extra layers of flavour – key in plant based recipes! – and to evaporate any more water lingering in the spinach. Bonus, the filling can either be made ahead or used immediately.
The spinach mixture is delicious on its own, but especially good folded into filo triangles – and it’s easier than you think! Brush the filo with olive oil and cut into strips, add the filling, and fold several times to create a cute little packet. Take a look at the recipe video to see how it’s done.

Easy mini spinach pies, made with vegan tofu feta and filo dough for a simple appetizer that works for almost everyone.
Prep Time 30 minutes
Cook Time 25 minutes
Total Time 55 minutes
Ingredients
500 grams / 18 oz. frozen spinach, thawed and squeezed dry 
1 cup leek, chopped 
¼ cup green onion, chopped 
¼ cup dill, chopped 
2 tablespoons fresh rosemary, chopped 
3-4 garlic cloves, minced 
½ teaspoon sea salt, more to taste 
Pepper to taste 
9 sheets phyllo dough, thawed 
¼ cup + 1 tablespoon olive oil 
2 tablespoons sesame seeds 
½ a batch tofu feta, crumbled (see below) 
Tofu Feta
400 grams / 14 oz. extra-firm tofu, cubed 
¼ cup apple cider vinegar 
½ teaspoon sea salt 
Pinch pinch oregano (dried or fresh) 
Instructions
1. Preheat the oven to 190C / 375F and line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
2. Heat the 1 tablespoon olive oil in a frying pan on medium low heat. Add the leeks and saute for 5 minutes or until they begin to soften. Add the garlic and green onions and cook for another few minutes until they too soften.
3. Next add the thawed spinach, dill, rosemary, salt and pepper. If you're using the vegan feta, now is the time to add it. 
4. Continue to cook this mixture for a few minutes to allow any residual moisture to evaporate. Taste and adjust seasoning as necessary.
5. At this point the filling can be set aside or used right away. To make the triangles take one sheet of filo and brush it lightly with some olive oil. Lay another layer of dough on top and bush it lightly with olive oil. Finally add a the last layer of filo, and brush it lightly with oil (this makes three layers total).
6. Take the three layered piece of filo and cut it into 4 strips along the long edge. Working quickly (so the filo doesn't dry out too much) add around 3 tablespoons of spinach filling to one strip and begin to fold up like a triangle. If you're having trouble with the folding see the video above.
7. Continue in this manner until all the filling is used. Once you have around 12 triangles, brush them one more time with a little olive oil and sprinkle with sesame seeds. 
8. Bake for 25-30 minutes or until golden and crisp. Serve warm.
Tofu Feta
1. Combine all of the ingredients in a large bowl. Cover and refrigerate to marinate, at least four hours, preferably overnight.

Hi Ailim, I’m so sorry about the delay. Sophie (the author of this post) is unavailable to comment right now, but I thought I could share some insight. My best guess is to form the triangles ahead of time, but don’t bake them. Arrange them in a single layer and seal tightly in a container. You can also freeze them this way, as well. I would bake the frozen (do not thaw) pastries as above. They make take a few minutes longer. I hope this helps! Again, we’re really sorry to delay our response on this for you.

Hi Sophie, I clicked the link for how to fold the triangles and the link sent me to an image logo for alldomains.com. Any chance you can check the link so I can see how to fold the phyllo? Thanks so much!

These look so good! I’m Greek so we have these all the time but I have never seen them with the seeds on top – such a great addition! I will have to try that for my next batch :)

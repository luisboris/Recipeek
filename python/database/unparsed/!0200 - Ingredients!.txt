leek risotto recipe step 1][3]
Step 1) – First thing first make a vegetable stock: you’ll need it to cook risotto. You can make it the day before and keep it in the refrigerator. Reheat when necessary. Then clean the leeks. Remove the dark green part of the leek and the last part with the roots. Then remove even the hardest outer leaf, which you can add to the stock for more flavor.

Leek Risotto Variations
There are several ingredients that go very well with leeks. Let’s see together what they are and what delicious recipes we can make with rice and leeks:
Leek Risotto with Gorgonzola Cheese
If you like strong flavors and love cheese, we recommend replacing the butter with 70 g (2.5 oz) of Gorgonzola cheese at the end of cooking. The strong and decisive flavor of Gongorzola goes very well with the sweet and delicate flavor of the leek.
Leek Risotto with Italian Sausage
If you have richer tastes, you can add a touch of flavor and color with a crumbled sausage. Add the sausage to the stewed leek, before adding the rice. Risotto with leeks and sausage is very popular in northern Italy.
Leek Risotto with Crispy Bacon
Finally, when risotto with leeks in ready, serve it in a plate but first sprinkle it with small crispy diced bacon, previously toasted in a very hot pan.

Leek is a popular vegetable in many countries and especially in France, Holland and Wales. In Italy leek grows mainly in the north and in particular in Piedmont region.
The most famous variety of leek in Italy is called _“lungo d’inverno”_ , also known as the _“gigante d’inverno”,_ characterized by very long stems (up to 80 cm/ about 30 inch), perfectly white, tender and tasty. Every year, at the beginning of November, the “Leek Fair” is in Cervere (Cuneo), visited by lovers of good Italian cuisine.
Another very good and well-known variety of Italian leeks is also produced in Piedmont in _Carmagnola_ in the province of Turin. The town of Carmagnola is also very famous for the production of fantastic bell peppers IGP (Protected Geographical Indication). A true Italian gastronomic excellence, with which to make a delicious Peperonata!
The leek called “ _Long Sweet Leek of Carmagnola”_ is characterized by a remarkable tenderness and a very sweet flavor and is also very digestible.

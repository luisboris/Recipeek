Instructions
Soak the white beans in a large bowl of cold water for 12 hours.
Drain the beans, and place into a pressure cooker with enough boiling water to cover. Attach the lid, and once the pressure is up, reduce the heat to medium, and cook for 30 minutes.
Meanwhile, in a large saucepan, melt the butter, and fry the onions over medium-low heat for 5 mins until they start to become translucent.
Sprinkle over the flour, and stir well. Add the garlic, and continue to cook for 5 minutes, stirring regularly. (If you’re using sausages and bacon, add them now.)
Add the stock to the pan, and mix everything well, ensuring there are no lumps.
Add the boiled and drained beans, marjoram, and thyme. Taste, and season with salt and pepper.
Cover the pan, reduce the heat to low, and simmer for 40 minutes, until the beans are soft.
Remove the pan from the heat, and stir in the sour cream a little at a time, making sure it doesn’t curdle.

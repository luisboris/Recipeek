Instructions
1. (One day in advance) Place the dried chickpeas and baking soda in a large bowl filled with water to cover the chickpeas by at least 2 inches. Soak overnight for 18 hours (longer if the chickpeas are still too hard). When ready, drain the chickpeas completely and pat them dry.
2. Add the chickpeas, herbs, onions, garlic and spices to the large bowl of a food processor fitted with a blade. Run the food processor 40 seconds at a time until all is well combined forming a the falafel mixture.
3. Transfer the falafel mixture to a container and cover tightly. _Refrigerate for at least 1 hour or (up to one whole night) until ready to cook._
4. Just before frying, add the baking powder and sesame seeds to the falafel mixture and stir with a spoon.
5. Scoop tablespoonfuls of the falafel mixture and form into patties (½ inch in thickness each). It helps to have wet hands as you form the patties.
6. Fill a medium saucepan 3 inches up with oil. Heat the oil on medium-high until it bubbles softly. Carefully drop the falafel patties in the oil, let them fry for about 3 to 5 minutes or so until crispy and medium brown on the outside. Avoid crowding the falafel in the saucepan, fry them in batches if necessary.
7. Place the fried falafel patties in a colander or plate lined with paper towels to drain.
8. Serve falafel hot next to other small plates; or assemble the falafel patties in pita bread with tahini _or_ hummus, arugula, tomato and cucumbers. Enjoy!
Notes
Cook's Tip: You need to start with dry chickpeas, do not use canned chickpeas here. You will need to begin soaking the chickpeas overnight, allow up to 24 hours.
Falafel Recipe variations: Variations of this recipe may call for flour or eggs. If you prefer, you can add 1 to 1 ½ tablespoon of flour to the falafel mix or 1 egg. I did not use either, and the falafel mixture stayed well together.
Pro Tip for Frying: When you fry the falafel patties, you want to achieve a deep golden brown color on the outside. More importantly, the patties need to be fully done on the inside. Your frying oil needs to be at 375 degrees F, for my stove, that was at a medium-high temp. Be sure to test your first batch and adjust the frying time as needed.
Popular falafel sauce: tahini sauce is what is traditionally used with falafel. I use organic tahini paste by Soom, and here is my tahini sauce recipe.
Baked Falafel Option: If you prefer, you can bake the falafel patties in a 350 degree F heated oven for about 15-20 minutes, turning them over midway through. Use a lightly oiled sheet pan, and you might like to give the patties a quick brush of extra virgin olive oil before baking.
Pro-Tip for Make-Ahead: To make ahead and freeze, prepare the falafel mixture and divide into patties (up to step 6). Place the patties on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper and freeze. When they harden, you can transfer the falafel patties into a freezer bag. They will keep well in the freezer for a month or so. You can fry or bake them from frozen.

I never leave comments, but I have to on this recipe. I am currently making my fourth round of falafel from this recipe. Follow it to a T and they'll come out perfect every time. Thank you so much for the recipe! It is THE. BEST.

Wonderful falafel. It does take some planning but once you have it all mixed together it’s not a problem. I made a double batch and froze them. I brought some to another household and air-fried them (360f/15min). They turned out very crispy and nice. A Middle-Easterner gave his stamp of approval. My mother baked hers but found from frozen she needed to go up to 400 but she thoroughly enjoyed them. Canned chickpeas was always the mistake in the past but happy to have an authentic recipe for this crowd-pleasing vegetarian meal. I thoroughly enjoy all your recipes on here. 
Thanks,
Tom

I love these falafel! I've made them a few times now and they work out every time and always impress. I recently got a nice batch of cilantro and I'm dying to make some falafel, but it's proven difficult to get dried chickpeas... is it possible to substitute black beans or another bean? How would this work? Every black bean falafel recipe I've seen online uses pre-cooked black beans which is throwing me off, and I would like to use this recipe anyway!

Hi, Jenna! You could try dry split fava beans here. Just soak the beans overnight as indicated in the recipe and follow from there.

I did not have any success with this recipe. I found there was much too much fresh herbs which completly changed the colour and taste of the authentic falafel I've had in the past. I woukd definitely try it again but cut back on the fresh herbs and increase the dried one. Thank you

This recipe came out perfectly the first time and is now a staple in our house. Soaking the dried garbanzo beans is a critical part of this recipe and I cannot thank you enough for starting me on the right path. It would be incredibly frustrating to put in all of the prep time only too see the falafel balls disintegrate in the oil. 
I am finding myself cooking more and more food from the mediterranean region. It is healthy food, not too hard to make, and tastes so much fresher than anything else. I do not eat meat/poultry and only a little seafood and it works for my dietary needs as well.
Thanks again for creating this website as a resource.

If I wanted to freeze the mixture, do I add in the baking powder, then shape, then freeze? And do I need to defrost the patties before frying or can they go straight from freezer to hot oil?

Hello! Yes, add the baking powder, then shape, then freeze. When you're ready, you can cook the patties right from frozen. Enjoy!

My husband has asked over and over for falafels, but since I wasn't familiar with them I was scared to try. I found your recipe and watched the video, and they are awesome!! Hubby is thrilled and they are delicious, especially with your tahini sauce. Thank you so much!!

This is the first time I have made falafel from scratch and this recipe is terrific. I added smoked paprika and more cumin since I love spices. My family wanted to eat them like popcorn. I think it's key to toast and grind cumin seeds - it added wonderful flavor. I'm glad I have extra to freeze!

My first attempt with falafel 
I made a few measuring errors such as an extra cup and a half of chick peas. 
I used the whole bag which was about 3 and a half cups. 
I did start with dry CP's, and soaked them over night. 
Of course that error threw the ratios for everything else off. 
We had to add two eggs, and about 1/2 cup of flour to get them to hold their shape. 
They were absolutely fabulous!. 
Not sure now if I should do it right next time of "my" way.

I have the condition where cilantro unfortunately tastes like soap to me. Is there a good substitute for cilantro in this dish?

Hi, Conner. If you don't enjoy it, you can omit the cilantro and simply compensate using more parsley and dill and a touch more cumin. Hope this helps.

Hi, AJ. I have not personally, but other readers have. Here's what one has suggested: Air Fry at 375 degrees F for 5 minutes on each side. Spray a little oil oil on them prior to frying them.

This recipe was a hit with my extended family who love falafel. It came out nice and fluffy inside with a nice crunchy exterior and had an impeccable taste. 100% would recommend anyone who is looking for a sure shot falafel recipe to try this recipe out.

Is the 2 cups of chick peas measured after they have soaked overnight? Or is the a dry measurement?

Do the chickpeas not get cooked ahead of time? I have a bit of a sensitive belly, and am worried that not cooking them will not go over well. Will this recipe still work of they're cooked?

Hi, Sarah. No, you do not cook them ahead of time. I find they don't bind well and may fall apart if you cook them first.

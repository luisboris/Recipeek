Instructions
Preheat oven to 400°F (200°C). 
Mix together the flour, powdered milk, salt, yeast and baking soda.
Add the olive oil and warm water.
Mix together using your hand to bring the dough together. Knead for 10 minutes. 
Cover the dough and put in a warm place and allow to double in size.
Pour out the risen dough onto a well floured surface. Cut into four pieces. With oil on your hands make a hole in the middle of each piece of dough and shape each into a ring.
Mix the egg white with the 2 tbsp of water and whisk together. Brush each bread round with the egg white wash. 
Generously sprinkle the sesame seeds onto the rings of dough. 
Bake for 30 minutes or until golden brown.
Notes
When making bread it is important to have a very hot oven. Using a baking stone is always preferred if possible.
If the dough is too wet, add some flour, and if too dry add water. You want dough that is just a tad sticky and not too dry.

Chef T., Can I use the same amount of bread machine yeast? And, how long is the second and third rise? Is it one hour or one hour and a half? Afraid of over-proofing. Also, I like the fact that there is no sugar involved!

You can use the same amount of bread machine yeast as this should be just normal instant yeast. There’s only two rises needed for this recipe. The first needs to be risen until it has doubled in size (this is a better measurement than time as there are many factors in the environment that affect rising time). For the second, let it rise until you can poke the bread with your finger and that indent stays. Let me know how it goes!

I made it and so good. Chef, on your video it says 500 F but your written recipe is 400 F, I followed your written recipe and it turns out good as well.

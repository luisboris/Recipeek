METHOD
1. Prepare the galette dough. Pulse the ingredients together in a food processor (I prefer to work the dough with my hands). Add more cold water a little a bit at a time if the dough feels dry. Flatten and fold the dough before wrapping it to set. Refrigerate for 30 minutes.
2. Preheat oven 200°C /392°F. Prepare the filling. Mix blueberries, cornstarch, and muscovado sugar together. When using fresh wild berries the given 1,5 tbsp of cornstarch is enough. If using frozen wild blueberries, use them straight from the freezer and add a bit more cornstarch.
3. Shape the galette. Place it on a piece of parchment paper and work the dough with a rolling pin. Leave 3cm of the border around the edge. When ready, transfer it on a baking tray.
4. Add the blueberry mix in the middle of the galette. Fold the edges in and give finishing touches by brushing the edges with whisked egg and drizzle some caster sugar on top.
5. Bake for 25-30 minutes in the middle rack until the bottom is ready. Transfer the galette to a wire rack to cool. I prefer to serve this warm with vanilla ice cream, but you can also let it cool completely.

This is actually my second blueberry dessert
So it happens that when you ask people to go foraging together you get an invitation for an afternoon coffee with fresh blueberry pie. Yum! We all four ended up home with full buckets and baskets. Could not have been luckier, we had perfect timing and wonderful weather to start the foraging season.

Have you tried rye flour in sweet pastries?
I’m curious to know if using rye flour with desserts is a Finnish/Nordic thing only. Have you made or eaten some pastries/desserts with rye flour as an ingredient? 
For us Finns, rye is a national treasure. The thing is that most of us miss real rye bread when away from home for longer periods of time. Luckily nowadays I know how to bake homemade rye sourdough wherever in the world, you can also check my trusted vintage recipe here to learn to bake your own rye sourdough.

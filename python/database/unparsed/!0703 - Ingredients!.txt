About This Recipe
Baingan bharta or eggplant bharta is an _India style smoky roasted eggplant mash_. The whole eggplant is roasted over direct flame until it is soft and smoky and then the pulp is cooked with mild spices.
Baingan ka bharta is made in _many different ways_ in different regions. In Maharashtra, it is called vangyache bharit, chokha in Bihar, and kathirikai gothsu in Tamil Nadu. The recipe I am sharing today is a Punjabi style baingan bharta which is now popular not only in Indian but all around the world.
Smoky flavor, spicy masala, _and no hint of slimness anywhere_ , baingan bharta is vegan and gluten-free too. 
During winter, I prepare this bharta recipe as often as I can, _because the seasonal eggplants are way more nutritious than the ones available during other seasons of the year._
The best way to roast the eggplant is on _direct flame_. You can either do it on a stovetop or on a BBQ grill. If these are not available, then you can roast them in an oven or air fryer too. 
So, if you also have not tried it yet, _it’s time to give this delicious sabzi a try and it tastes amazing with hot tawa parathas._

Baingan Bharta Ingredients.][5]
_Baingan_ – Getting the right eggplant is very important. Choose the ones with shiny, firm, and glossy skin. There shouldn’t be any marks or dents on it. Choose the eggplant with a dot at the bottom and not a line. The one with a dot is the male fruit with fewer seeds.
_Oil_ – I personally like to prepare in mustard oil, as it adds a beautiful flavor and is also considered very healthy. 
_Green Chilies_ – You can adjust the amount of green chilies as per your taste and spice level. I like it spicy and thus I add more chilies.
_Spice Powders_ – To enhance the taste, even more, we will add in some basic everyday spice powders such as coriander powder, turmeric powder, red chili powder, garam masala powder, __ and dry mango powder.
_Peas_ – This is optional, but I like the bite green peas add in the soft bharta. If you do not have fresh peas, you can use frozen green peas too. Just add the frozen green peas to a bowl of warm water for 5 minutes, discard the water and they will be ready to use.
If using fresh peas, then boil them in water until tender before adding to the bharta.
_Fresh Coriander_ – Finally, add some more taste and a refreshing flavor by garnishing it with finely chopped coriander leaves. 
_Others_ – We will also need some basic ingredients such as garlic, onion, ginger, tomato, and salt, that combined will enhance the taste of this bharta.
How to make Baingan Bharta?
To start making the bharta, first, roast the eggplant. Wash it and wipe it with a kitchen towel. Make 8-10 slits in it using a paring knife all over.
Slits made in baingan with a knife.][6]
Insert one whole peeled garlic clove in each slit. Roasting the garlic cloves along with the eggplant gives a very delicious flavor to this bharta. So do not skip this step.

Keep the eggplant on the direct flame over a wire rack and roast from all the sides on medium heat till the skin is blackened and it is soft from inside. Keep rotating it every 2-3 minutes while roasting. It will take 10-12 minutes to roast it properly. To check if it is roasted well, insert a knife in it. The knife should go inside the pulp easily. 
Note – Roasting the eggplant over direct heat gives it a very nice smoky flavor. So I highly recommend roasting it over direct flame. But you can also roast it in an oven, air fryer, or BBQ grill or even steam it in a pressure cooker.

Remove the roasted eggplant from heat and let cool for 20 minutes. Remove the burnt skin by peeling it using your fingers. Chop off the top. Wash the peeled eggplant to remove any trace of charred skin. Cut it into half and remove the seeds. Mash the pulp using your fingers, fork, or a potato masher and keep it aside.

Note – If mustard oil is not available, you can cook the bharta in any oil.

Note – If using frozen pea, wash and drain them before adding them to the pan. If using fresh peas, cook them in water until tender, drain and add to the pan.

How to make it without roasting eggplant?
To make baingan bharta without roasting, wash the baingan and peel it. Cut it into cubes. Pressure cook with ½ cup water until it is softened. Then use it in place of roasted baingan.
How to cook baingan in a pan?
Add the baingan slices in a pan. Cover it with water and cook till they are soft. Once done, let them cool down and mash to use in the bharta. Cooking the baingan in the pan will not give you the smoky flavor. 
Pro Tips By Neha
Use _plump large sized eggplant_ to make baingan bharta. Make sure they are the variety with fewer seeds.
Discard the _large seeds_ after roasting the eggplant. Also check for worms inside the pulp.
You can also _boil_ the eggplant to make the bharta but trust me, the taste will be only mediocre.
To _check if eggplant is cooked_ from inside, insert a knife in it. If the knife passes through easily, it means it is done.
_Mustard oil_ gives a lovely pungent flavor to this dish, however, you can cook it in any other oil too.

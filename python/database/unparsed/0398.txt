On January 25, The Museum of Food and Drink and WNYC radio will launch a discussion on Italian olive oil with two independent producers from Tuscany and Calabria, Casa Caponetti and EXAU. Viola Buitoni, a La Cucina Italiana contributor and Italian chef, will lead the virtual panel, guided tasting and cooking demonstrations. 
On January 25, Italian Chef, Instructor and Food Writer Viola Buitoni will host a virtual discussion on the wonders of Italian olive oil. The event is part of “Food for Thought,” a new event program created by The Museum of Food and Drink and WNYC radio's Greene Space in New York City.
I like to speak to people who cook every day. Teach them how to live in the kitchen and how to keep their senses engaged,” said Buitoni, who spent most of her adult life traveling and working in food in San Francisco, New York and her native Italy. “Taste should be the last of their concerns.”
During the event, Buitoni will interview two small olive oil producers from the regions of Tuscany and Calabria: EXAU and Casa Caponetti. Together, they will explore the essentials of the delicious liquid, from growing and tasting to buying, and of course, cooking. For the event’s finale, Buitoni will prepare two dishes, showing how the distinctly flavored olive oils can be used. 
Both olive oil producers already enjoy a large following in the US. Founders Skyler Mapes and Giuseppe Morisani's EXAU extra virgin olive oil made Oprah's 2020 Favorite Things, and Lorenzo Caponetti's organic olive oil is allocated to New York City's top chefs, like Dan Barber from Blue Hill Farm and Daniel Humm from Eleven Madison Park.
Buitoni said the producers have graciously offered to share their knowledge despite the time difference. (The talk will take place at 2 AM Italian time.) 
Reserve tickets for “First Pressed: An Olive Oil Exploration" on Monday, January 25, 2021 from 8:00 PM to 9:30 PM EST.

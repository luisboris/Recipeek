Instructions
1. Gather your spices.
2. Optional: Toast your whole spices in a dry skillet for a few minutes until fragrant. Be careful not to burn them! Once their aroma is released, remove it from heat and let cool completely.
3. Combine spices in a spice grinder, coffee grinder, or mortar and pestle. You can also use your Mockmill! (See instructions below.)
4. Grind until they are a fine powder.
5. Transfer to a small, air-tight container. If desired, use a fine-mesh strainer to filter out any larger particles.
6. Store your Chinese five-spice powder in a cool, dark location. Use up within a matter of months for the best flavor.
I do recommend whole spices, but if any of your spices are ground, go ahead with grinding the whole ones and simply mix in the ground spices after the fact.
Using Your Mockmill
You already know I love my Mockmill. It is the easiest, cleanest, and quietest grain mill I've ever used… and it can grind many spices, too!
To use your Mockmill to make Chinese five spice powder, first cut the cinnamon sticks into smaller pieces. Place a small bowl or jar underneath the chute to catch the spices. Turn your Mockmill on to its finest setting. Pour all of the spices into the hopper, and watch them come out of the chute… finely ground!
To clean your Mockmill after grinding those fragrant spices, simply mill some white rice. I show you how here.
The Mockmill is a wonderful way to grind spices because it offers more control of milling grade, continuous flow, and it's much easier to clean than your typical spice or coffee grinder!
For more information on the Mockmill, check out our Home Grain Milling 101 series. You can also visit this link for 5% off (no coupon code needed) your purchase of a Mockmill!

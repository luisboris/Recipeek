Method
Melt the butter in a small saucepan over low-medium heat. Once the butter has melted, add the milk and honey to the pot and remove from the heat.
Place the starter into a large mixing bowl, and add the milk mixture. Stir to combine.

After 12 hours, the dough should be doubled in size. Lightly flour a work surface and place the dough onto it.
Gently press the dough into a rough oval, about 2cm (¾ inch) thick. Use a cookie cutter or glass to cut the dough into rounds. Pictured are 8cm (3 inches) in diameter, but slightly larger or smaller are fine.

Place the rounds onto a parchment lined baking sheet. Press the remaining dough scraps together and repeat until all of the dough has been used.
Cover the rounds with a damp tea towel and set aside to rise again at room temperature for about 2 hours. After this time, the muffins should have risen slightly but not doubled in size.

Once the muffins have proved, heat a frying pan over medium heat. Once the pan is hot, carefully remove an English muffin from the tray and place it into the dry pan. Don’t add oil. Don’t worry if it deflates slightly when moved, it’ll puff up again. 
Cook for 4-5 minutes on one side, then flip and cook another 2-3 minutes on the second side. The muffins should about double in height and are ready when both sides are golden brown. Repeat until all of the muffins are cooked.
Cool fully before slicing and toasting. The English muffins freeze well for up to a month in an airtight container, and keep at room temperature for about 5 days.

Tips and Notes
Don’t worry if the muffins get a little misshapen when you take them off the parchment to cook. Either use a spatula to gently push them back into shape once in the pan, or leave as is – a slightly oblong muffin will taste the same as a round one!
Adding the milk to the pan of melted butter before adding to the bowl to mix heats it up just slightly. Using cold ingredients can cause a much slower rise for sourdough (which can seem like no rise at all, sometimes) so heating it very slightly makes for a more consistent result.
If you like cornmeal added to your English muffins, sprinkle some on the parchment before placing the cut out muffins onto it, and add more to the tops before the second rise.
If the muffins aren’t rising as much as you’d like, the frying pan probably isn’t hot enough yet. They should about double in height while cooking. Much like pancakes, if the pan isn’t heated properly, the first couple will flop.
We keep the dough in a cool place, but not refrigerated, for the bulk ferment. If leaving dough that has milk in it out of the refrigerator is concerning for you, simply refrigerate it instead. It will require a slightly longer proofing time to double in size.

Substitutions
Substitute up to 50% of the white flour for whole wheat to make whole wheat English muffins. You can probably do 100% but we haven’t tested it.
Use vegan butter or olive oil and non-dairy milk for vegan sourdough English muffins. 
Honey and sugar can be used interchangeably, and maple syrup or another sweetener would be fine too.

I just made these and they worked perfectly! I used 20% whole wheat flour (1/2 c.), but that was the only change. Fluffy and delicious!

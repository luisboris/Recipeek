MAIN COURSES / SECONDI PIATTI, PIZZA/FOCACCIA/BREAD
Rianata Trapanese
Posted by POLENTAEBACCALA on JULY 26, 2019
Here it is another type of focaccia/pizza that is possible to find travelling through Italy 
This is a recipe typical of the city of Trapani, in western Sicily, and its name derives from an ingredients which is used in high amount, the oregano (which in local dialect is called “riano”). And all the other ingredients are simple but together they create an amazing flavor.
The history of this product it’s not too old, it seems it was created for the first time after the Second Worldwide War by such Michele Calvino, one of the first “pizzaioli” in Trapani.
The easiest recipes suggest usually shorter times and more yeast, but as always we can obtain better results if we give to the dough more time for the maturation, and that’s what I always do.
Let’s see.
INGREDIENTS (2 pieces of good size):
500 g flour (70-80% durum, 20-30% wheat)
325-350 ml water
35 ml extra virgin olive oil
10 g sugar
15 g salt
5-6 g fresh baker’s yeast
Topping:
500-600 g fresh ripe tomatoes
100 g Pecorino cheese
6-7 salt cured pilchards/anchovies
1-2 cloves of garlic
dried oregano
extra virgin olive oil
First of all prepare the dough: pour the water, the extra virgin olive oil, the sugar and the crumbled yeast in a bowl, then start adding gradually the sifted flours while mixing. When the dough it’s almost done add the salt, and keep working for about 10 minutes. I also suggest to do 2-3 series of folding, every 15 minutes. Then place it in a bowl greased with some olive oil, and let it rest at room temperature for about 6-8 hours.
Before taking the maturated dough, cut the tomatoes into big slices and remove the seeds. Wash out also the salt from the salt-cured fish.
Divide the dough into 2 pieces (or not, if you want to make a bigger one in an oven tray), and flatten it with your hands (not too thick), on a working table where you have sprinkled enough flour. First add the pilchards/anchovies, then the minced garlic, the tomatoes, a lot of dried oregano (but without exaggerating) and for last the freshly grated Pecorino and a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil.
Let it rest other 30 minutes, then bake at 220 °C, static oven, for about 20-25 minutes. I did it directly over a pizza stone, if you do it on a tray don’t forget to grease the bottom.
Enjoy, if you want you can add some extra oregano also after it’s ready 
But you can make it also in an oven tray:
Products used:
Flour: stone ground organic “farina Buratto, Tipo 2” and stone ground organic “sfarinato di grano duro Senatore Cappelli”, both from Mulino Marino.

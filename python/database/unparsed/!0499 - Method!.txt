directions:

3. melt the chocolate in 15-sec intervals in the microwave until smooth. place a small dollop on top of each ball &amp; sprinkle sea salt on top. 
4. refrigerate again until set. then enjoy! 🤍🍫🥜][18]
squeezed in a little &ldquo;me time&rdquo; at the gym this morning ☺️ it got me thinking - we don&rsquo;t always &ldquo;have&rdquo; time, but we can almost always make the time. sacrifices might be involved, but your physical &amp; mental health is important! 
bull;&bull;
take 🤍 care 🤍 of 🤍 yourself 🤍!][19]
there are no rules against drinking a protein shake out of a coffee mug from a brewery, right? 😂
bull;&bull;
my favorite chocolate-PB protein shake:
1 frozen banana
1 handful spinach 
1 handful of ice cubes 
1 tbsp natural peanut butter 
1 tbsp cacao powder 
2 scoops @drinkorgain Creamy Chocolate Fudge Whey protein 
bull;&bull;
use &ldquo;hungryhaley&rdquo; for 30% off your order of @drinkorgain 💪🏼🤍][20]
I refuse to let you forget about these Easy Salted Peanut Butter Cup Energy Bites! ☝🏼they&rsquo;re getting me through a busy week of work, &amp; a stronger-than-usual craving for sweets 🙂
bull;&bull;
RECIPE:
1 1/2 cup pitted medjool dates 
3/4 cup creamy natural peanut butter 
4 oz. dark chocolate, roughly chopped
3/4 tsp. coconut oil 
1. pulse the dates &amp; PB in a food processor until no lumps remain &amp; the mixture is sticky. 
2. form into golf-ball-size portions &amp; then flatten gently into a cookie shape. refrigerate. 
3. gently melt the chocolate &amp; stir in the coconut oil to thin it out. drop a dollop of melted chocolate onto each energy bite, sprinkle with sea salt, &amp; refrigerate until the chocolate has set. 
4. ENJOY 🍫🥜&hearts;️][21]
the only person or thing with the power to make today &amp; this week good or bad is you, great or not so great is you. just because it&rsquo;s Monday doesn&rsquo;t mean it needs to be a &ldquo;Monday&rdquo;. you are in control of your mindset, &amp; that is so incredibly powerful! ✨💪🏼
bull;&bull;
last week was a very &ldquo;bleh&rdquo; week for me, so my focus this week is to just make it better 😂 
bull;&bull;
mindset is everything! move &amp; nourish your body. practice gratitude. live in this moment. &amp; remind yourself that you are powerful 🤍][22]
Friday night plans include... ☝🏼🤩 support local. eat pizza. have a great weekend everyone!][23]
holy molyyyyy this 22-minute bodyweight AMRAP almost beat me this morning 😅 but NOPE I finished it 💪🏼 now it&rsquo;s your turn!
bull;&bull;
repeat each circuit AMRAP-style / 10 minutes. 
CIRCUIT 1:
toe-touch squat jumps x20
walk-out narrow push-ups x8
split squat jumps x20
push-up to plank T x8
CIRCUIT 2: 
squat jacks x20
plank shoulder tap w/ swimmers
squat jumps w/ 180 degree turn
cross-boys knee taps w/ lateral step
bull;&bull;
you know the drill - save this, tag your workout buddy, &amp; get to it! 👏🏼][24]
every form of exercise provides some form of benefit\(s\) to the body &amp; mind. we could argue all day about which is &ldquo;better&rdquo; - going back &amp; forth between this benefit &amp; that benefit. but what matters MOST is what exercise YOU enjoy ☺️
bull;&bull;
I like lifting, and I also really enjoy spin workouts. I almost never do yoga, and I frequently walk on the treadmill or outside. that&rsquo;s what works for me. it&rsquo;s not right or wrong by anyone&rsquo;s definition but my own. &amp; the same goes for you - what&rsquo;s right for you is what benefits YOUR body &amp; YOUR mind. so embrace that! 🤍][25]
made tater tot hot-dish today so, I think it&rsquo;s safe to say, I am OFFICIALLY a good Minnesotan. ☺️
bull;&bull;
amp; for a first-time try, I kinda&rsquo; nailed it. toot toot! 👏🏼 message me if you want the recipe! minnesota][26]
a 15-20 minute quad &amp; glute dumbbell only workout that will leave 🔥 you 🔥 burnin&rsquo; 🔥!
bull;&bull;
perform this like a circuit if you want it more intense with a higher HR, or go with straight sets if you want to slow it down &amp; focus on strength. save the post, tag your workout buddy, &amp; get to it! 🤓💪🏼
bull;&bull;
5 \(sets\) x 15 \(reps\) DB RDL
5x20 DB top-loaded squats
5x15 DB sumo squats 
5x15 sumo squat pulses \(DB optional\)
bull;&bull;
have fun 😈🍑][27]

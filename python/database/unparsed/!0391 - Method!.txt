Method
1. Bring a saucepan of salted water to the boil. Add the pasta and cook for 6 minutes. Next add the broccoli to the saucepan and boil for a further 5 minutes or until the pasta is al dente and the broccoli is cooked, then drain and reserve the pasta water to use in the next step.
2. Meanwhile add the kale, spinach, garlic, walnuts, lemon juice, nutritional yeast, basil, olive oil, large pinches of salt and pepper, and 1.5 cups of pasta water to a food processor. Process until smooth.
3. Mix the green sauce with the pasta and stir in the mixed green leaves, then serve.

This was easy to prepare in a few minutes and absolutely delicious! My partner loved them as well and thatâ€™s quite a challenge as he doesnâ€™t like much of my vegan cooking. I cooked the brocolis a bit longer so they would be softer for him. I cannot find kale where I shop so I used chards instead. Thank you for this great recipe that will be used every two weeks or so in my home!

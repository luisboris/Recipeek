Instructions
Heat the oil or lard on medium heat and brown the meat on all sides for a few minutes.
Add onions, mix well and cook for 5 minutes over medium-high heat, stirring constantly.
Add tomatoes, hot pepper (optional), allspice, paprika and caraway. Mix well.
Cover with hot broth and mix well. Season with salt and pepper. Simmer for 2 hours over low heat, stirring gently.
30 minutes before the end of cooking, add marjoram and flour diluted in a small amount of boiling water. Adjust the seasoning if necessary.
Check the tenderness of the meat. Cooking may have to be extended if necessary. If this is the case, adjust the amount of broth accordingly. The sauce should be plentiful and unctuous.
Serve hot with fresh bread, as well as sliced scallions.

Great idea! I love this. I am thinking that I will do it because this is so useful. I am really grateful to give recipe ingredients and instruction. The most important thing is, it has included huge information which is important. I am very happy to visit here.

I have a question about opening the jar to let the gas out … For the first week. Is it needed? Or do I just close it tightly and leave it to ferment in a cool/dark place? Also, if I’m using more than one jar … Should I put 3 cups of vinegar each jar with the amount of salt recommended or what? 
Thank you for the recipe.

Hello Sara 
You shouldn’t let any gas out. Just leave the jar unopened for a few months at least. For the amount of vinegar, just follow the ratios based on your jar sizes. Enjoy!

Once I make it can it be stored in a fridge? I live in a very humid place.

Teresa, you can, but they will not keep as long. Never tried, but I’d say a few weeks in the refrigerator.

Mike 
What do you recommend for a lid? I use mason jars and put wax paper over the jar. But the vinegar still corroded the lid and the vinegar evaporated out of the jar.

Never had that issue Scott, but I’d say to use some kind of cheesecloth or thin canvas (hessian or burlap). Good luck!

A company called Krautsource sells mason jar lids and bands made of stainless steel. Pricey but they don’t corrode.

I was taught to cover the jar with cheesecloth and refill as the vinegar evaporates. Any comments?

Yes Lisa, you can use this technique to allow the fermentation gases to evaporate, especially at the beginning of the process.

I’m having to open the jar to fill it with vinegar every 2-3 weeks because so much vinegar evaporates. Is that ok and is there a way to stop it from evaporating so much? I’m planning on waiting 15 years before eating. At what point does it need to be refrigerated?

If the jar is properly sealed, the vinegar should not evaporate.

I started some in 2015. I opened it today and all the vinegar was evaporated. It tasted ok. So I am going to refill with vinegar. I don’t know if this is ok or not.

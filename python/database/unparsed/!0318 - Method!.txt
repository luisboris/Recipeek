Instructions
In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment combine melted butter, flour, salt, and lukewarm water. Mix at medium speed about 1 minute until a smooth and elastic dough forms.
In a small saucepan (with a lid) bring water to a boil then remove the pot from the heat, empty the pot and dry it with a dish towel. Line the pot with a sheet of parchment paper, put the dough into the pot and put the lid on. Let sit for 30 minutes at room temperature.
Preheat the oven to 350¬∞F (180¬∞C) and line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
Meanwhile, in a small bowl combine raisins and rum. Let sit for 30 minutes. Then discard the rum.
Peel, core, and cut the apples into small stripes (batonnets, see image above). Combine apples with lemon juice. Add cinnamon, sugar, raisins, almonds, and vanilla extract. Set aside.
Lay a thin kitchen towel preferably with a pattern flat on the counter. Sprinkle with flour. Roll the dough out as thin as you can. Brush it with a little bit of melted butter.
Then use your hands to carefully stretch it until it is about 18x12 inches (45x30 cm) big and you're able to see the pattern of the dish towel through the dough.
Brush half of the melted butter over the rolled out dough.
The long side should be facing you. On the right side of the rectangle, leave a few inches space, then sprinkle the breadcrumbs top to bottom over the dough in a 6-inch thick line. Leave a 2-inch margin at the top and bottom of the strip.
Pile the apple filling on top of the breadcrumbs. Use a slotted spoon so the liquid stays in the bowl.
Fold the 2-inch margin at the top and bottom of the dough over onto the filling then roll up the strudel from the short side with the help of the towel. Tuck the ends.
Carefully transfer the Strudel to the prepared baking sheet, seam side down. Brush with a little bit of melted butter.
Bake for about 50 minutes in the lower third of the oven, until lightly golden on top. Brush strudel with remaining melted butter every 20 min while in the oven.
Let cool for 10 minutes then sprinkle with powdered sugar and serve warm.

You can totally drink it but don‚Äôt use it in the strudel it will make it soggy.

I was very excited to make this recipe as a treat for my German father in law. 
Upon making the pastry I found that the fat and water amounts were not enough for the dough to come together. I needed to add approximately 1 table more melted butter and 2 tablespoons more water. 
After that the dough was a dream to work with. 
A useful tip for working with the dough on the tea towel is dusting the towel with flour. I was successfully able to hand stretch the dough too the point I could see the pattern of the towel. 
The strudel is now in the oven, is picture perfect and smells heavenly. 
I‚Äôm going to make a quick vanilla sauce with custard powder to serve with it. 
Thank you so much for your recipe!!

Will you be posting the vanilla sauce recipe? When we were in Austria the strudel was served with it. Delicious!

Can this be made a few days ahead of time and stored in fridge/reheated?

Yes, you can make it ahead of time but I would recommend freezing the baked apple strudel. Just let it cool completely, wrap it airtight, and freeze it then let it thaw and put it in the oven at 350 F for about 10-15 min to reheat. Refrigerating it for a few days will make it soggy.

Amazingly easy and delicious recipe!! I had a little leftover filling with using two large apples, so I just made it into jam.

I have a made a French tart with a much simpler procedure and have come out good. Being the first time with this recipe I ended having too much apple filling even I used 4 small apples. The dough rolls better if you make it right on the parchment paper you are going to bake it. Other than that it came out delicious. Thanks Julia!! Canada is cool.

I was thinking of making this for my family and younger sisters, do you if I could make it without the rum?

Yes, you can. If you can‚Äôt use rum you can soak the raisins in lukewarm water or apple juice.

alcohol from rum is evaporated in the oven and only the aroma remains so that it can be used even when cooking for children but if I‚Äôm not at home, I don‚Äôt think the taste changes a lot, so it‚Äôs possible without rumü•∞‚ù§Ô∏èüíã

Hi Julia, I‚Äôm very much a newbie at this baking game haha, and don‚Äôt have the luxury of a stand mixer or the worktop space for one (London kitchen sizes are naff unless you earn a fortune! So going to cheat a little first with some shop-bought dough! The recipe is making my mouth water already but I‚Äôm ‚Äòconfused.com‚Äô about the rolling up and the six-inch strip, as to which direction the filling is laid out and then rolled. Any chance of a pic with the ingredients on before rolling up and another being rolled? Or am I being thick here?? 
So I‚Äôm going to try a good old English apple pie first (just like ‚Äòmum used to make‚Äô -sounds better with Italian ‚ÄòMama‚Äô!). Her family owned a cafe/restaurant so she grew up a dab hand at classic English cooking, mains and desserts (or dinner and ‚Äòafters‚Äô as we called them then) But the rum-soaked raisins are going in! And I‚Äôm hoping when I get around to the Apfel Strudel that it will conjure up long-forgotten tastes and smells, from Austrian tea rooms in the ski holidays of my youth.

Hi, 
What kind of apples do you think is best for this strudel?
Thanks in advance.

Julia Foerster says
January 25, 2021 at 12:58 pm
You can use any kind of apple but a tart apple with a bit of sweetness works best similar to what you would use for apple pie. Jonagold, Golden Delicious, Granny Smith, Honeycrisp, or a combination of these would work great.

Can I make it and put it in the fridge overnight so it just needs to be baked off in the morning?

I haven‚Äôt tried that so I‚Äôm not sure. I think the apple filling would soak through the dough overnight and then it wouldn‚Äôt crisp up when baking the next morning.

I always get confused with this point ‚Äì 1/4 of butter then melt or 1/4 cup of melted butter. Please advise.

You measure 1/4 cup of the cold, solid butter and then melt it in a pan or the microwave. Hope this helps!

Can I make the dough a day before and roll it out to make the strudel the next day?

I haven‚Äôt tried it so I can‚Äôt say for sure. But I think it would make it more difficult to roll out and stretch the dough.

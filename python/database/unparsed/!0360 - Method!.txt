Instructions
In a bowl, whisk together the flour, eggs, milk, and salt. Stir until the batter is well combined and develops bubbles. You can also use a mixer. The batter should neither be too thin nor too thick or it will be difficult to make the spaetzle with your spaetzle maker. Let the batter sit for 5-10 min.
Put a colander into a bowl to drain the Spaetzle once cooked and bring a large pot of water over high heat to a boil, add about 1 Tbsp of salt to the water, and reduce temperature to a simmer.
Press batter through a spaetzle maker, a large holed sieve or colander into the simmering water.
Work in batches, after using about 1/3 of the batter stop adding new spaetzle and let them cook for about 2-3 minutes, or until they float to the top. Stir occasionally. Use a slotted spoon to transfer the spaetzle to the colander so that excess water can drip off.
Serve the spaetzle immediately or saute them in butter to crisp them up a little. If you don't serve or saute them right away, add 1 or 2 Tbsp of butter to the hot spaetzle to prevent them from sticking together.
Notes
UPDATE 10/23/19: Recipe has been re-tested because of reader feedback and amount of milk has been increased from 1/3 cup+2 Tbsp to 3/4 cup of milk.
This makes a big batch of Spaetzle that is perfect for a big family dinner.
Clean used equipment with cold water, the dough is very sticky and gets stickier when using hot water.
Leftover Spaetzle can be stored, tossed with some melted butter, in an airtight container in the fridge for 3-4 days. To reheat, saute them in some butter.

It was pretty good. Sauteed with butter and coriander.
Unfortunately, I skipped to the recipe and just made it. Didn’t see that, AFTER the recipe is described, another step to increase the amount of milk is added. Wonder if it would’ve been better like that commenter described.

I’m not really sure what you’re referring to, Chance. The notes in the recipe card below the instructions just say that the amount of milk was increased when the recipe was retested compared to an earlier version of the recipe. All the measurements listed in the ingredients section are correct, there is no additional step to increase anything. So if you used a 3/4 cup of milk you did everything right.

Fluffy Chickpea Scramble (30 minutes!)

Plate with delicious Chickpea Scramble, roasted sweet potatoes, avocado, cilantro, and baba ghanoush][1]
Chickpea scramble! Ever tried one?
It’s the perfect solution when you want something egg scramble-like without eggs or tofu (no shade on tofu, but some folks avoid soy, so this is another workaround).
Chickpeas are a delicious source of plant-based protein and fiber, _and_ they take on flavors well. The only “problem” with chickpeas as a base is 1) they don’t _bind_ together well, and 2) they don’t _quite_ emulate the fluffy texture of eggs or tofu.
To the drawing board I went. I experimented, I asked your guys’ opinion on Twitter and Instagram, and I experimented some more. And one suggestion – eggplant – was the golden ticket!
Plate with chickpeas for making gluten-free vegan Chickpea Scramble][2]
This recipe is simple to make, requiring just 30 minutes and 10 ingredients to make! I even include some workarounds that make it _even_ faster + easier if you’re short on time.
The “secret” to this scramble is baba ganoush __ , which whips up in less than 15 minutes. It’s what helps bind the chickpeas together while also providing provide flavor, creaminess, and a bit of fluffiness!
Eggplant for the win, once again.
_Note:_ you can learn about baba ganoush here.

While the eggplant is roasting, season your chickpeas! I went with Indian-inspired flavors including a healthy mix of turmeric (an amazing anti-inflammatory!), ginger (great for digestion), and cumin (also helpful for digestion).
A pinch of salt, pepper, and smoked paprika bring even more flavor to this delicious and wholesome scramble.

I hope you all LOVE this scramble! It’s:
Fluffy 
Flavorful 
Wholesome 
Satisfying 
Easy to make 
Super tasty
This would make the perfect breakfast or lunch when you’re craving something satisfying yet healthy. While it does require 30 minutes from scratch, you can use store-bought baba ganoush to cut that down to 10-15 minutes _or_ make the seasoned chickpeas and baba ganoush ahead of time to throw into the skillet throughout the week!

Ingredients
US Customary – Metric
QUICK BABA GANOUSH _(or sub store-bought baba ganoush)_
1 large eggplant (sliced horizontally into 1/4-inch rounds)
1 Tbsp avocado or grape seed oil (or other neutral, high-heat oil // omit if oil-free)
1 pinch sea salt (plus more to taste)
3 Tbsp lemon juice
2 Tbsp tahini (ground sesame seeds)
1 large garlic clove (minced)
CHICKPEA SCRAMBLE
1 3/4 cup cooked chickpeas (drained but not rinsed, cooking liquid reserved // 1 15-ounce can yields 1 3/4 cup cooked chickpeas)
1 1/4 tsp ground turmeric
1 1/4 tsp ground cumin
1/4 tsp ground ginger
1 pinch smoked paprika ( _optional_ )
1/4 tsp each sea salt + black pepper (plus more to taste)
1-2 Tbsp water (to thin)
1 Tbsp avocado or coconut oil
4-6 Tbsp baba ganoush (recipe above or store bought)
FOR SERVING _optional_
Roasted sweet potatoes or other vegetables
Ripe avocado
Steamed kale
Brown rice or cauliflower rice
Cilantro
Instructions
If using store-bought baba ganoush, skip this step. Otherwise, preheat oven to high broil, move a rack to the top of the oven, and line a baking sheet with foil (foil is best for broiling as parchment paper can burn).
Slice the eggplant and arrange on foil-lined baking sheet. Lightly drizzle both sides with oil and sprinkle with sea salt. Then broil for 2-3 minutes on each side, watching carefully as it can burn easily. You’re going for a deep golden brown, not black.
Remove from oven and stack the eggplant. Fold the foil around the eggplant to steam for 5 minutes.
In the meantime, add chickpeas and 2-3 Tbsp (amount as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size) of their cooking liquid to a shallow mixing bowl. To a separate small mixing bowl, add turmeric, cumin, ginger, paprika, salt, pepper, and water to thin and mix into a pourable paste. Taste and adjust flavor as needed, adding more spices for flavor or salt for saltiness.
Pour spice mixture over the chickpeas and mash half of them with a fork, evenly distributing the spices until the chickpeas are coated. Sprinkle the chickpeas with a bit more salt for flavor. Set aside.
Unwrap the eggplant and peel off most the skin – if well steamed, it should peel right off. Don’t fuss too much about getting all of the skin off – a little bit is fine!
Transfer eggplant to a food processor (or mixing bowl) and add lemon juice, tahini, garlic, and another healthy pinch of salt. Blend (or mash/whisk) until a paste is formed (see photo). Taste and adjust flavor as needed, adding more lemon for acidity, garlic for zing/spice, tahini for creaminess, or salt for saltiness. Set aside.
Heat a large skillet over medium heat. Once hot, add 1 Tbsp (15 g // amount as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size) oil and chickpeas. Stir to coat and cook for 3-4 minutes, stirring occasionally. Then add desired amount of baba ganoush – 4-6 Tbsp (amount as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size).
Stir to combine and cook for 3-4 minutes more or until the scramble is slightly drying out and taking on a golden-brown color. Taste and adjust flavor as needed, adding more fresh garlic for garlic flavor/zing, salt for saltiness, or pepper for a little heat. You can also add more baba ganoush for fluffy texture + flavor.
Serve the chickpea scramble as is or with desired garnishes / sides. I love roasted sweet potatoes, avocado, cilantro, and extra baba ganoush on the side. Hot sauce is also delicious.
Best when fresh, though leftovers keep in the refrigerator for 3-4 days. Reheat on the stovetop or in the microwave until warm.
Notes
If subbing store-bought baba ganoush, this is a 7-ingredient, 10-minute recipe! 
To roast sweet potatoes, cube a large sweet potato (skin on or off), place on a parchment-lined baking sheet, drizzle with oil of choice (I like avocado), and add a sprinkle of salt. Roast at 400 degrees F (204 C) for 15-25 minutes or until golden brown and tender.

I was looking for a way to use up uncooked eggplant slices and this fit the bill perfectly. This also satisfied my desire to incorporate turmeric in my diet more often, and I love that this has ginger in it as well. 
I never heard of baba ganoush or tried it before and enjoyed it, and it paired well with the scrambled chickpeas.
Healthy, filling and tasty — a great meal to make regularly. Thanks!

I’ve had an egg allergy my whole life and I made this for the first time today. Completely impressed, it came out perfect! The spice blend was delicious (I added more smoked paprika than recommended because I love it) and the recipe was so simple. I used store bought baba ganoush and added extra garlic paste. Served on wholemeal toast with a few slices of honey roast ham as a Saturday lazy breakfast. Perfection!

Made this and it was awesome! I made it into tacos which was great. I didn’t have eggplant and wanted to use what I had so I made the tahini sauce exactly the same way just without the eggplant and it was still very good. We had it for lunch but my husband said he could easily see eating this for breakfast. If I was gunna make this for breakfast I think I would want to add some meatless sausage or something but it was great without it too! Highly recommend! Keep in mind though it definitely doesn’t taste like eggs, which is fine for us but anyone new to eating vegan/vegetarian etc may think it’s an egg substitute and it’s not, it’s its own thing.

This was just the creative take I needed on a “scramble” to make a fun and nourishing breakfast with the ingredients I had on hand (I used store-bought baba ganoush that was leftover from a meal earlier in the week). I was also surprised by just HOW well the scramble paired with avocado – yuuuuum!

Made this with sides of couscous + frozen peas, and crispy hash potatoes with cumin, turmeric, slightly too much cayenne, and ginger. It was DELICIOUS and incredibly filling. Omitted the eggplant because I didn’t have one, but otherwise made the chickpea “eggs” with everything else that would have gone in it (the tahini lemon juice mixture). Put it on high heat in a cast iron and then threw in some BREAD CRUMBS which made it even crispier and gave it a flaky/crispy texture. Heartiest breakfast in a while. Will be making again. Soon.

Hi Jennifer, we haven’t tried that, but another reader mentioned a zucchini-based baba ganoush. If you press “ctrl+f” on a PC or “command+f” on a mac, a find bar should pop up that allows you to search for specific words (such as zucchini) in the post and comments. Hope that helps!

This is one of the most delicious things I’ve ever had for breakfast! I made a tahini-free babaganoush because my daughter is allergic to sesame. I roasted 2 large eggplants in the oven at 400 degrees for around an hour, let them cool, scooped out the insides, put in food processor with 2 cloves of garlic and the juice of one lemon and then processed for about 15 seconds. Other than that I followed the recipe exactly and found the spice mixture to be perfectly balanced flavor-wise. I served it on top of hashbrowns. I can’t wait to have it again!

This scramble was delicious. I had a little trouble peeling the skin off the eggplant, and just ended up trimming it off. I served on tortillas with avocado. I love that I have left over baba ganoush. I went ahead and mixed a pre-blend of the spices. Now everything is ready to go, and I should be able to whip up at least two more batches in less than 10 minutes.

We haven’t tried that and think it wouldn’t end up being a very cohesive scramble. We have a vegan scrambled eggs recipes coming up that might interest you! Otherwise, perhaps subbing the baba ganoush for a tahini-free hummus would be your next best option? Hope that helps! If you give it a try, we would love to hear how it goes!

You can make a zucchini-based baba ganoush instead! Just slice the zucchini in rounds or long slices and grill or roast them before blending. Also, you can skip the tahini and sub a bit of extra oil (maybe 2-3 tbsp rather than 1) to get that creamy consistency.

I have a lot of Indian black salt (egg smelling) from when I was making tofu scramble. Soy isn’t my friend. Would you recommend using it in this? If so, how? I’m VERY recipe dependent so “just play around with it” doesn’t work for me lol.

If using canned chickpeas, are we supposed to leave the chickpeas un-rinsed and preserve the liquid from the can? Hopefully the answer is yes, b/c I’m guessing this won’t be answered right away and I’m about to cook supper. ;)

Hi, I dont know but it seems that since the liquid in the chickpeas is used as an egg replacement (aquafaba) it probably helped you. 
How about telling us how it turned out?

This is a good recipe! The eggplant baba is very good. 
The eggplant’s skin didn’t come off easily for me, so I cut it off with a knife and ate the outsides (which were yummyyy!) because I didn’t want to trash anything edible. 
My sister and her friend really enjoyed the dish and went back for second and thirds!

I made this last weekend, and to be honest didn’t love the scramble (baba was great!), however, my fam really liked it (so may just be me), but I don’t see it replacing tofu scramble as our regular. However, I had leftover scramble and baba and the next day had that on a toasted sandwich with all the toppings and it was FANTASTIC!! So making again this week, it will be a regular alternative with the chickpea salad sandwich. Thanks for the recipe!

I heartily agree with the above comment! I live in North Africa and can’t say enough good things about your site and recipes…thank you, thank you, thank you! 
I just want to suggest a shortcut with the eggplant. My Egyptian friend who taught me how to make baba ganoush would just poke two holes in a whole eggplant and stick them whole into the oven to roast for 20-30 minutes (depending on the size). When they are cooled, you can slice them open and just scoop out the innards. 
Excited to try this!

Interesting, I’m excited to try this! When I think of a chickpea scramble I tend to think equal parts chickpea flour and water, a little salt, black salt, nooch, and turmeric cooked like a pancake on one side then broken up like eggs. This is a great way to use up those sometimes annoying aquafaba side products ??

Happened to have all the ingredients on hand today so I tried it for lunch. It was good. Very satisfying and filling. The recipe makes more baba ganoush than required, but this isn’t a bad thing. I’m not sure I would compare it to scrambled eggs, but more like a dry curry/ dal type dish.

This is BRILLIANT. Adding the baba is so unique but when I think about it, makes perfect sense! Cannot wait to try this out sometime. You are so inspiring girl.

I wonder how hummus would work in this as a sub for the baba? I’m gonna try it!

I tried it and it’s not quite as good (texture/flavor-wise), but still tasty!

YES!!!! I’ve been looking for a good egg-less/tofu-less scramble for a while now. Can’t wait to try it out this weekend!

This looks great! I recently started making quiches with chickpea flour – would love to see a scramble recipe or quiche recipe using that too! I actually used your hashbrown crust idea and it was delicious!

Ingredients
Canned chickpeas , rinsed and skins removed. If you want to cook your own, you’ll need about 1.5 cups after removing the skins.
No-stir nut butter or sunflower seed butter – If you use sunflower seed butter, be aware that it will turn green when baking soda is added to it.
Coconut oil
Maple syrup – If you don’t need a vegan option, honey also works
Baking soda – This may seem like a strange ingredient for dessert hummus, but this article from Eating Well explains the benefits of adding baking soda to beans.
Coconut milk – coconut cream and non-dairy cream are good substitutes
Sugar-free powdered sugar – If you prefer a less sweet flavor, you can omit this. We used a sugar free powdered sugar made with monk fruit to keep is refined sugar free.
Sugar free white chocolate chips and/or dark chocolate dips. I like using Lily’s chocolates or Enjoy Life foods vegan dark chocolate chips.

Recipe notes
For a smoother, creamier texture : Removing the chickpea skins makes the dip A LOT smoother and silkier, like a dessert hummus! It’s worth the extra step and it’s very easy to do.
To adjust the sweetness \-- You can adjust the sweetness of the chickpea cookie dough by adding more or less maple syrup or powdered sugar. I use monk fruit powdered sugar to make it refined sugar free.

This unrefined sugar snack doesn’t get much easier to make. The most time consuming part is removing the skins. After that, you just toss everything into your food processor and blend it up!

Do you have to remove chickpea skins? Nope, not really. They’re completely edible, but as I said earlier, removing them gives the dessert hummus a creamier texture.

I have some other ideas for using chickpeas to create unrefined sugar treats, too! Save the water from the can and use it to create aquafaba. Or, maybe a pan of Cinnamon Chickpea Blondies.

punjabi mooli ke paratha | radish paratha recipe with step by step photo and video recipe. mooli paratha is a traditional punjabi cuisine delicacy served usually with butter, curd and pickle. these exotic stuffed paratha can be divine when served with lip smacking curries. while, it is usually served during breakfast. but can also be consumed for lunch and dinner too.
i have always been a huge fan of stuffed paratha recipes. however, my husband prefers plain roti or chapathi recipe. hence, i usually end up preparing just those. but, my husband likes south indian recipes prepared from radish. especially radish sambar and radish pachdi. even my intention was to prepare the same when i bought it last week. however, for some reason i could not prepare it and radish was unattended in fridge since last week. suddenly i remembered mooli paratha recipe and i was able to convince my husband for it.
radish paratha][3] ![radish paratha][4]
furthermore, before discussing about the radish paratha recipe, i want to highlight the health benefits of radish. radish is very good for liver and helps to cure jaundice. in addition, it also improves the metabolism and digestion. hence reducing the risk of piles and constipation. furthermore, radish is diurectic in behaviour which helps to increase the production urine. finally, radish is considered to be the cure for skin cancer and any respiratory disorders.
finally, do check my other indian paratha recipes collection and indian roti recipes collection. particularly, lachha paratha , aloo cheese paratha , garlic naan , rumali roti recipe. also do check indian curries recipe collection and punjabi cuisine recipe collection.

notes:
firstly, squeezing water from radish is optional. however it helps to get rid of bitterness.
furthermore, i have added less oil, however you can add more oil or ghee while roasting to make it more tasty.
moreover, adjust the spices according to your taste. you may need to be careful while serving to kids with spicy paratha’s.
finally, do not over stuff the stuffing if you are beginner as it may be difficult to roll. you can also, mix stuffing to dough and than roll the paratha’s.

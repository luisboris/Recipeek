Craving for a breakfast that provides instant satiation?
Then without a second thought, always call dibs of this yummy, desi flatbread popularly known as Paratha.
Stuffed or just rolled with spice mix plus one veggie, any time you eat a paratha served with a generous dollop of butter, you know that you aren’t going to feel hungry anytime soon!
Because of the fact that I am North Indian, it is difficult to imagine our weekly breakfast without making parathas at least once or twice a week.
So, Aloo Paratha, Pudina Laccha Paratha, Gobhi ka Paratha, Keema Paratha are some of the instant hits in my family.
Almost as tastier as Palak Paneer Sabzi, Palak Paneer Paratha gets made with a generous layer of spinach, wheat flour which is stuffed with paneer and spices!
Imagine a heavenly green flatbread which oozes out with nicely melted, grated paneer, onions and spices – ain’t that just enough to give a FoodComa , peeps?
To cook this palak paratha, spinach puree is added in the paratha dough and then it is stuffed with a spicy paneer mix.
Roll paratha and then fry until crisp and golden brown. You can serve it with sides of pickle and raita.
This is definitely an improvised version of Paneer paratha as it is much tastier and healthier.
Instead of making a spinach puree to add in the flour, you can also finely chop the spinach and add it in the flour and then knead it.

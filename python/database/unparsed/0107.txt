Bila Fazolova Polevka][7]
Frugal, filling, and deliciously hearty, this _b√≠l√° fazolov√° pol√©vka_ (white bean soup) is one of the culinary mainstays of the Czech Republic.
For the average Czech, soups are an everyday part of life, and usually form the first of three courses for the main meal of the day (which is generally around noon or early afternoon). Until relatively recently, meat was only really consumed once a week (usually on Sundays) and on high days and holidays, so it comes as no great surprise then, that vegetarian soups are common.
Having said that, b√≠l√° fazolov√° pol√©vka can be made with chicken stock, and also have a little bacon and/or sausage added to it ‚Äì often as flavorings, as opposed to foods in their own right.
B√≠l√° fazolov√° pol√©vka in other countries
Slavs are the largest ethno-linguistic group in Europe, and are to be found all over Central, Eastern, and South-Eastern Europe (and into Asia too), so it‚Äôs only natural that Slavic food travels too. Having lived in several Slavic countries, I have noticed that despite claims to the contrary from various locals, there are many dishes which are pretty similar to each other, if not exactly the same!

This similarity is even to be found in Romania and Hungary too ‚Äì which are not Slavic lands ‚Äì very often because all of these peoples share common culinary root sources‚Ä¶ notably the Roman and Ottoman empires.
Another reason for similar culinary traditions is simply climate and geography. Historically, cuisines develop from whatever foodstuffs are available, and evolve from there via travel and creativity. Obviously, early Slavs would not have been putting potatoes into their soups but for the past few centuries, this cheap and nutritious vegetable has become ubiquitous in not only Slavic cuisine but across the world, so it makes sense that it‚Äôs now become as much a part of the food as anything else.
Vegetarian Soup][14]
Variations of b√≠l√° fazolov√° pol√©vka can be found across Europe, and some of them have already been featured on 196 flavors: 
In Romania: _ciorbƒÉ de fasole_ 
In Bulgaria: _bob chorba_ 
In Serbia: _pasulj_ 
In Slovenia: _jota_ 
In Cyprus: _fasol√°da_ 
In Slovakia: _kysl√° fazuƒæov√° polievka_ 
In Croatia: _grah i varivah_ 
In Italy: _minestra di fagioli_ 
In Macedonia: _tavche gravche_
This is by no means an exhaustive list ‚Äì wherever you go in Europe, you‚Äôll find some kind of similar bean soup!
B√≠l√° fazolov√° pol√©vka in traditional Slavic cuisine
Because beans are abundant in the Czech Republic, and full of protein (great for re-fueling when working on the land!), soups are often thick and hearty, and sometimes fortified with cream ‚Äì in this case, sour cream ( _zakysan√° smetana_ ). Naturally, this also means that nourishing and filling meals can be made very frugally from what‚Äôs to hand. 
Like so much _cucina povera_ , there are several variations of b√≠l√° fazolov√° pol√©vka. Sometimes, it‚Äôs made with potatoes and carrots, sometimes just potatoes. Both potatoes and carrots may be cut into chunks or grated/shredded, and then saut√©ed in butter before adding the rest of the ingredients. 
Some cooks add parsley, and some prefer milk over cream, and add a spoonful of vinegar to sour the soup. Others even add a little sugar to balance the flavors. Some use plain water instead of stock or broth, and some don‚Äôt add sour cream.
In a culture where culinary skills are mostly handed down from mother to daughter, it‚Äôs unsurprising that there‚Äôs no one definitive recipe for this bean soup, and non-Czechs using Google to find an authoritative recipe may find their quest to be something of a minefield of contradictions!
What is consistent though, is that the beans are soaked overnight, and partially cooked ‚Äì usually in a pressure cooker ‚Äì while the vegetables for the soup are being saut√©ed. Once the vegetables are softened, and have given off their flavor, a little flour is added to make a roux, and then hot liquid is added, followed by the beans, herbs, and seasoning. The soup is then cooked until the beans have become soft, and then if using, the sour cream is stirred through before serving.
Regardless of whether you have it as part of a larger meal or on its own, dished up with a chunk of fresh bread, b√≠l√° fazolov√° pol√©vka is delicious and filling, and perfect for keeping you warm during colder weather. 
Dobrou chu≈•!

I tried this recipe out for the first time and loved it! Of course, it‚Äôs Twelve at night now since I started making it too late, but it was seriously worth it to have this soup! I can‚Äôt wait to make it for my parents and sister as a quick and rather easy meal that is not only delicious, but delectable as well‚Ä¶ the smooth creamy texture is to die for, the subtle taste of the onions and beans made the soup, and the fresh Thyme sprig added a note of warmth to the soup, it‚Äôs a recipe I will definitely come back to üôÇ

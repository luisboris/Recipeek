Recipe Card
Parathas or say flatbreads are very popular in the northern regions of India.
As Wikipedia mentions, Paratha is like a combination of ‘Parat’ and ‘Atta’ which signifies various layers of the dough that we cook to make this flatbread.
When it comes to this North Indian dish, there are various types of Parathas that can be made, from simple plain paratha to spice flavoured laccha parathas to stuffed parathas, options are many to choose from!
I always save up my Stuffed Paratha recipes for breakfast or dinner, but then there are plain paratha and spiced parathas that go really well with Dal and Curries.
And one such Paratha is, PUDINA PARATHA.
I also like to include them in my festive meals.
Pudina Paratha as the name suggests is made using whole wheat flour which is later flavored with mint powder or kasuri methi powder.
The flavor of pudina or say mint powder is so refreshing that you would regret for not using dried mint powder in your paratha recipes before.
Here are some more Paratha recipes, that tastes delicious with Curries and Dal – Tawa Paratha, Ajwain Paratha, Masala Paratha and Laccha Paratha.
About This Recipe
Pudina Paratha is a simple Indian flatbread where the dough is made with whole wheat flour and then it is flavoured with kasuri methi powder or mint powder. 
Also, this is a Lachha Paratha which means that it has various crispy layers of cooked flour which taste delicious with rich Indian curry.
You can make a simple paratha too without layering it like a lachha paratha if you wish.
If you don’t find mint easily in your area, then you can may be buy it in bulk from the vegetable market, make them dry and use its powder just like me.
You can also use this method in case, you have extra mint leaves, that might go bad before you use them.
Benefits of Mint
Talking about the nutrients, some of the benefits of including mint leaves in your diet are that mint helps in digestion, it cures nausea and even headache.
Moreover, mint even prevents cough.
It also helps in weight loss and combats memory loss. 
It is very refreshing and is thus good to consume in Summer.
Pro Tips by Neha
In the restaurants, this paratha is made using only All Purpose Flour or Maida.
But since I was making it at home, I added some wheat flour to it to.
It’s totally up to you to use the flour of your choice. Using only maida will make it even more crunchier.
And using some wheat flour in it will make it khasta.
Knead the dough until smooth and soft and make sure to let it rest.
This will make sure that maida becomes pliable and it will be easier to roll the paratha.
Instead of making a lachcha paratha, you can also make a simple triangular pudina paratha.
Transfer the paratha on the griddle only when it is nicely hot.
You can add chaat masala, some red chilli powder etc in the dried mint to make your parathas even more tastier, tangier and spicier.
Can you use fresh Mint to make this Paratha?
I prefer to use mint powder in this recipe, but you can use finely chopped fresh mint in place of dry powder.
If using fresh mint, chop it very finely and knead it with the dough.
You can use ½ cup of fresh mint per 2 cups of flour.
Can you freeze this paratha?
These parathas can be easily rolled and frozen until you are ready to use them.
Just roll the paratha as mentioned. Keep a sheet of parchment in between the parathas and freeze in freezer safe bag for up to 3 months.
When ready to use, just take out one paratha, put it on the hot griddle and fry as mentioned below.
You don’t have to thaw the paratha before frying.
Serving Suggestions
You can serve this paratha with any Indian curry.
It goes well with both Vegetarian and Non Vegetarian Curries and all the Raitas.
Even Mango Pickle and Chilli Pickle goes well with this paratha.
How to make it Vegan?
To make vegan Pudina Paratha, replace ghee with vegetable oil for layering the paratha.

Instructions
In a large measuring cup or bowl we place the yeast (you can break it up) about a half cup lukewarm water (not hot) and a pinch of sugar and mix. Let it sit for about 10 minutes when it starts bubbling on the surface. If you are using dry yeast follow the manufacture’s directions.
In a large bowl, mix the flour, 1/2 teaspoon salt and the sugar.
Once the yeast mixture has bubbled, make a whole in the middle of the flour mixture and add the yeast mixture, than add 1 1/2 cup water and start kneading until you have soft (not thick dough) that does not stick to your fingers- I kneaded for about 10 minutes. If you are using a mixer, use the dough hook and mix on low speed until dough is soft and does not stick to the sides of the bowl. If dough is too dry add gradually a bit more lukewarm water.
Shape into a ball and place in a greased bowl. Cover and let it sit in a warm place until it raises (about an hour).
Once the dough has risen, knock back the dough and shape it in a long loaf about 1 1/2 inches (3 cm) wide. Cut (not all the way through) in slices and cover the dough and let it rise again.

Preheat the oven at 350 F (180 C).
Now bake the loaf for about 1 hour.
Remove from the oven and lower temperature of oven to 210 F (100 C).
Once the dough has cooled just enough handle it, separate the slices (I used a knife to do this) and spread them on a pan.
Bake for 2 hours until completely dry.
Let them cool completely and store on airproof container

I made these for the first time today and they came out rather small–about the size of a large cracker. They rose nicely, but seemed to shrink in the oven. I did handle the dough a lot when shaping the logs and cutting them. Should I have been more gentle? Let them rise longer? Not as long? I followed the recipe religiously, making two 1 1/2 inch logs out of it . . . if you have any advice for me, I’d love to have it!

Hi Patricia, These are meant to be smaller paximadia. About 3 1/2 inch long 2 inches wide. Sometimes over kneading can cause shrinkage.

Mansoufeh: A Flavorful Dish from West Bekaa and Al Chouf
__Recipes __0
6]_Flattened mansoufeh balls_
_Mansoufeh_ is a comfort food in West Bekaa villages like Kherbet Qanafar, Ain Zebdeh and Mashgara and in villages across the Chouf district. It is a traditional vegetarian meal containing a delicious and healthy mix of wholegrain carbohydrates and veggies, which makes it a satisfying and energizing main dish.
Typically, _mansoufeh_ consists of bulgur ( _burghul_ ) rolled into small flat balls that are cooked in tomato sauce with chopped onions that are seasoned with sumac. It is customary for _mansoufeh_ to be prepared on Good Friday.
7]_Preparation of the mansoufeh dough_
Bulgur ( _burghul_ ) which is an important ingredient in Lebanese cuisine produced in the Bekaa Valley and one of the key ingredients of _mansoufeh,_ is a great source of complex carbohydrates packed with vitamins, minerals and fibers which can improve digestion and gut health.
Another ingredient in _mansoufeh_ is pumpkin, which is a superfood containing tons of minerals and vitamins and has low caloric content. Pumpkin, which is harvested in the Bekaa during fall, is an excellent source of vitamin A and C which helps boost the immune system. _Mansoufeh_ contains a generous amount of onions, which are nutrient-dense and are high in vitamins and minerals as well as antioxidants that help prevent several diseases.

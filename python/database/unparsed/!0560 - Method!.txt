I had the honor to teach 2 virtual team buildings this weekend ❤
Attendees from: UK, Portugal, France, Belgium, Germany, Poland, Australia, Singapore, China, Malaysia... wow!
We made a galette...but most importantly, we had fun and had 90 minutes to focus on being present ❤ with our hands covered in flour and butter.
Perfect during Thanksgiving weekend - because I cant be more grateful for doing this!
Hope everyone had a beautiful holiday!!

I made this sourdough banana bread for the croissant classes this weekend... and it was a success!! 
Plus I love having a versatile recipe that I can add a seasonal inspiration to it haha
So this is the banana sourdough bread... with apples ❤
It super easy! uses the discards... and has no refined sugar and whole wheat flour 👇

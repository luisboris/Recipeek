Instructions
In a medium mixing bowl, whisk together the chickpea flour, salt, and warm water until smooth. Ensure that the water is warm as it will help the batter thicken correctly. Set aside for 15 minutes.
Meanwhile, heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the mushrooms, leeks, and a pinch each of salt and pepper. Reduce the heat to low and cook, stirring often, until softened ‚Äî about 10 minutes.
Add the garlic and thyme and cook for 1-2 more minutes. Turn off the heat and stir in the nutritional yeast. Taste and adjust as needed, adding more salt to taste, black pepper for spice, or nutritional yeast for cheesiness. Set aside.
Heat a non-stick or cast iron skillet over medium heat (non-stick works best). Whisk the batter again to combine. It should be fairly loose. Pour 1/2 tsp of olive oil into the pan and rotate the pan to evenly spread the oil (if using a cast iron, we found a very thin coating of oil to work best ‚Äî in fact, in most cases, a seasoned surface with no additional oil should work well).
Scoop 1/3 cup (80 ml) of the batter into the skillet, quickly pick up and rotate the skillet to spread the batter into a 5-7 inch circle, then turn up the heat to medium-high and cook the pancake, undisturbed, until browned on the bottom and edges, about 2-3 minutes. Use a spatula to peek at the underside of the pancake to make sure it‚Äôs browned before flipping ‚Äî the pancake should lift away from the pan easily; if it sticks, let it cook a bit longer. Once ready, flip and cook for 1 minute on the other side. If you are using cast iron and the batter is sticking, wipe a small amount of olive oil across the entire surface of the pan and try again. Transfer finished pancake to a plate, turn the heat back down to medium, and repeat with the remaining batter.
Top the pancakes with the leek and mushroom filling and garnish with fresh thyme and nutritional yeast or green onion if desired.
Best when fresh. Leftovers will keep stored separately in the refrigerator for up to 2-3 days. Not freezer friendly. Reheat separately on the stovetop until warmed.

Notes
Using a cast iron skillet is more finicky because it does not change temperature as quickly as a non-stick pan. If the batter is sticking to the cast iron or cracking, that likely means it is not hot enough. Try cleaning the pan, increasing the heat, and trying again.

So dang yummy!! The first crepe I did was a disaster, the second one was a little better and then after that they all came out great. I used a non-stick pan, I think really the thing that solved the issue was getting the pan very hot, enough so that the batter immediately sizzled when I put it on the pan, after reaching that temperature I had no more sticking issues. The taste so was delicious and savory, definitely will be making again soon!

So before I started to make this recipe, I read all of the comments below. Like everyone else, the shiitake mushroom and leek mix turned out great, no issue. But‚Ä¶ I tried the chickpea batter and I couldn‚Äôt get the thin crepe like consistency when I followed the recipe. Instead, it was pretty thick. I didn‚Äôt have any clumps and after 15 minutes, the batter was even thicker. I had to add more water to make the consistency as described. And it was a lot more water than found in the recipe. When I put the batter in a non stick pan, in medium heat, it looked okay. But when I tried to flip it, it started to break apart. I waited patiently before I flipped it, but each time it was broken into bits‚Ä¶ The batter wasn‚Äôt too thin, so I couldn‚Äôt understand how the recipe would have worked for others. Needless to say, our family didn‚Äôt have the chickpea pancake for lunch, it was chickpea pancake bits‚Ä¶. From my experience, chickpea flour alone doesn‚Äôt hold very well‚Ä¶ so it‚Äôs often mixed with another flour or arrowroot starch. Did anyone else have the same experience? @MinimalistBaker ‚Äì can you share the brand of chickpea flour used and confirm if it was 100% chickpea flour?

Oh no! We‚Äôre so sorry to hear that was your experience! It sounds like it may have had too much water as that can lead to cracking and breaking. If you didn‚Äôt already reference the photos/video for batter texture, we‚Äôd suggest that! We used 100% chickpea flour (Bob‚Äôs Red Mill brand).

We made this recipe, and while the filling turned out nicely, the pancake ‚Äúbatter‚Äù was so watery we couldn‚Äôt control the size. Ended up having to make very large pancakes to ensure they were thick enough to fold and flip without tearing. Any suggestions?

Hi Theresa! It‚Äôs important to let the batter sit to thicken up slightly, so possibly giving it even longer next time could help. Thanks for sharing your experience!

This is the second time I made this recipe and I did use nutritional yeast this time rather than grilled chicken. It was delicious. Making the pancakes the second time around was a lot easier and I did 2 frypans at a time. I‚Äôm now curious what kind of variety I can come up with for fillings given health/dietary considerations. Very filling and satisfying, not to mention tasty.

My new go-to for lunch ‚Äì soooo good. This dish actually made me enjoy mushrooms (I used portobello). Also, I would suggest weighing your chickpea flour because the flour I bought said 4 tablespoons is 120g versus on the recipe here 120g equals 1 cup‚Ä¶something to keep in mind!

Absolutely delicious and will definitely make again. Followed the ingredients portions and got enough for two entrees. Even after 15 minutes, I was skeptical about the thickness of the batter. Decided to just go for it and it turned out lovely. I used a nonstick pan without oil and it flipped fine. Edits included salting mushrooms after cooking rather than before to reduce liquid pulled from them, topped stack of pancakes with a thin layer of spero sunflower vegan cream cheese. Finished with chives and a little truffle salt. Delicious and easy!

We made this recipe exactly as written except we doubled the amount of topping and ate the pancakes flat instead of folded over. This was maximum flavor for minimum effort! Very easy to make. I love the toasty, nutty flavor of the chickpea pancake. Shiitake mushrooms are definitely the way to go because given the minimal number of ingredients it really provides a lot more flavor. Love this recipe!

I was so happy to see this mostly bc of the pancakes! I grew up eating veggies filled pancakes but stopped making them since I didn‚Äôt have a vegan option, and this was perfec! 
The only thing is that I struggled with getting the batter right. The pancakes were too thick and they broke in the cast iron. Real bummer! What went wrong? I followed the instructions closely. Thanks!

We‚Äôre so sorry this one gave you trouble, Vicky! A few ideas here- 1) The batter may have been too thick, in which case we‚Äôre thinking maybe brands of chickpea flour vary? What brand did you use? 2) The pan may have been too hot, not allowing them to spread. And 3) We did have the most success with a non-stick pan versus a cast iron skillet. We‚Äôll see if we can play around more with a cast iron and troubleshoot!

I gave this another try! I used the same flour (sprouts brand) and my cast iron. It turned out amazing! Idk what happened the first time around, maybe the batter was too thick. I love this recipe so much. I haven‚Äôt tried it yet with your filling and looking forward to it! The filling I make is with peas corn carrots red and green peeper onion and garlic, all sauted and then I make a white vegan bechamel, just oat milk and corn starch, salt pepper and nutmeg, mix everything and yum! thanks a lot for amazing recipes always!

We followed the directions to a tee, and our batter turned out quite thin and runny. Maybe consider adding more water next time? We also used a nonstick skillet with no issues whatsoever. My cast iron is still not fully non-stick yet, so it can grip onto batters like this.

Vicky, we did some more experimenting with a cast iron and it is more finicky, but does work! We were able to replicate your issue with it cracking and found that it was because the heat was too low and so it didn‚Äôt cook fast enough and started drying out. Since a non-stick changes temperature more quickly than a cast iron, it‚Äôs easier to use. Hope that‚Äôs helpful!

Hi Hannah, that could work, but you‚Äôd probably have to play around with it a bit to get the right consistency. Chickpea flour is quite absorbent, similar to coconut flour, but we‚Äôre not sure coconut would be ideal in terms of flavor here.

I make chickpea pancakes all the time my kids love them. I like to use veggie broth instead of water for added flavor. I use plant-mylk to make a sweet version of chickpea pancakes and also add some vanilla and a splash of maple syrup to the batter then fill them with berry compote and a drizzle of almond or cashew butter.

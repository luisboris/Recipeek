Method 
1 Preheat the fan oven to 160 degrees. Grease and line the base and sides of a 20cm cake tin with parchment paper. 
2 Using an electric whisk, beat the eggs, caster sugar and vanilla extract until the mixture is pale and thick enough to leave a ribbon-like trail when falling from the whisk. 
3 Melt the butter and set aside to cool down slightly. Blitz half the peaches to a puree consistency. 
4 Combine the polenta, baking powder and ground almonds. Fold the dry ingredients into the batter, followed by the peach puree and melted butter. Stir well to combine fully. 
5 Spoon the peachy cake mixture into the prepared cake tin. Cut the remaining peach halves into wedges and arrange over the top of the cake. 
6 Bake on the middle shelf of a preheated oven for 50 minutes to one hour or until a skewer inserted in the centre comes out clean (to avoid the top of the cake overbrowning, bake uncovered for the first 30 minutes, then cover with tinfoil for the rest of the baking time). 
7 Make a syrup by heating the orange juice and sugar in a saucepan and simmering for two minutes, then set the syrup aside to cool down. Pierce all over the top of the cake with a skewer, creating tiny holes for the syrup to seep into, then use a tablespoon to slowly spoon it over the warm cake, being careful not to allow it to flow over the edges. 
8 Leave the cake to cool fully in the tin. If you want to preserve the vibrant look of the fruit on top, warm the apricot jam or redcurrant jelly and brush it over the top of the fruit pieces.
Variation 
Rather than peaches, ripe nectarines (a cross between a peach and a plum) and redcurrants glazed with redcurrant jelly would be delicious. Other classic fruit combinations include blueberries and lemon zest, blackberries with cinnamon, orange and cardamom, and fig and honey. Substitute 30g poppy seeds in place of polenta if you can’t get it.

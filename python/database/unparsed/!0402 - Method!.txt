Instructions
1. Combine the all purpose and cake flour with the salt and sugar. Whisk together to mix the ingredients evenly.
2. Using your fingers, cut the shortening into the flo7aur mixture until it resembles coarse corn meal. Using your fingers, toss the butter into the flour mixture. Allow the slices of butter to break up into slightly smaller pieces into the flour. Work quickly so the butter doesn't get warm. Don't break the butter down completely. There should be some large flakes remaining.
3. Pour the sourdough discard onto the flour all at once and toss to combine. Gently press the dough just until it comes together. It will look a little dry in spots. The moisture will redistribute in the dough as it rests.
4. Wrap the dough and refrigerate for at least 2-3 hours before using.
Notes
I based this recipe on my starter which is fed with equal _weights_ of starter, flour and water. You may need to adjust the amount of starter in the recipe based on the moisture level of your starter.

Hi, I'm making this for my pumpkin pie. Do I need to prebake the pie crust?

For pumpkin pie I would blind bake the crust so it doesn't end up soggy.

Any suggestions for doing this with a wheat-free discard? My daughter loves pies and I’ve made her a wheat-free starter but it’s a lot thicker than the normal one even though I do the same ratio of ingredients. I made this recipe over the summer with the regular discard and it was so good, I wanted to use it for pumpkin pie this week, but I feel bad not letting her eat the crust (it’s my favorite part!) Thanks!

It was extra crumbly so I added more water (not sure how much, a few splashes until it seemed good). I did have to mix it more though because I didn’t realize how crumbly until after I took it out of the fridge. And I had run out of shortening which is hard to get here (in the UK) so used more butter. Daughter had a taste as I was transferring her mini pies to another container and she said it was good, so it probably turned out fine. In future, I will just add some more water at the start. Thanks again!

Eileen Gray, yeah, it does. It’s not gluten that’s the problem (common mix-up, you can actually have one without the other!)
About to give it a try! We’ll see how it goes. She usually eats most things without complaining, so that’s good.

Hi Kim, sorry I don't have experience with wheat free recipes. Maybe someone else can make a suggestion? Would the entire recipe have to be wheat free?

Hello! I'm a huge sourdough starter fan and am so happy I found your website! One of my cookbooks is a book all about bacon and one of the recipes in the cookbook calls to use clarified bacon fat to make a pie crust. I'd love to make a pie crust using both sourdough starter and bacon grease! In your opinion, do you believe replacing the vegetable shortening for clarified bacon fat (cold) could work?

Yes. I almost always use leaf lard instead of vegetable shortening when I make pie dough.

I'm 'babysitting' the sourdough starter from work and need some discard recipes to try. This looks simple and delicious. Is it possible to make without the shortening, just substitute more butter? Thanks!

Yes!

Looks good and I'm about to try your recipe. But why perpetuate the myth that you need to discard starter? Sure there's a period in the beginning when it makes sense not to feed the whole developing starter, but after that, there's no reason to throw any starter away. Just keep the amounts small and then there's no waste. Make more if you want unfed starter.

There are a million ways to make and keep starter. For those who prefer not have less discard I recommend keeping a small starter.

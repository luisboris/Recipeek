Instructions
1. Heat the olive oil in a 10- or 12-inch nonstick skillet over medium heat. Add the scallions and onions and cook until soft, about 8 minutes. Add the spinach, season with salt and pepper and cook until all its liquid has evaporated, about 10 â€“ 12 minutes. Add the nutmeg, pepper, and feta cheese. Lower heat.
2. Using a wooden spoon, make 4 hollows in the spinach mixture. Carefully break and egg into each of them. Cook over low heat until the eggs are set to desired doneness. They should not be runny.
3. As the eggs cook, break apart each of the barley rusks into two halves. Dampen under the tap and let the water drip off. Place on individual serving plates. When the eggs are done, carefully divide the mixture with a spatula and serve one egg and the spinach mixture over each of the rusks or toast pieces. You can use good toasted whole grain bread instead of the rusks as well.

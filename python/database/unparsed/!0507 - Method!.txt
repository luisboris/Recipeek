Instructions
_You can watch the video in the post for visual instructions._
Add dried jackfruit (I used these jackfruit chips) to a bowl and pour in enough hot water. Let soak for 10-15 minutes, then drain. Skip this step if using canned young jackfruit.
Slice the jackfruit into strips. If using canned young jackfruit, shred the pieces by hand (or fork). You could also use a food processor and pulse just a few times.
Add all marinade ingredients to a bowl and stir with a whisk or spoon. Add the jackfruit and let it marinate for at least 15 minutes (the longer the better).
Meanwhile, make the vegan yogurt sauce by simply combining all yogurt ingredients in a bowl. Also, slice the tomato, cucumber, onion, and shred the cabbage.
Heat oil in a skillet and add the marinated jackfruit. Cook for about 10 minutes. Meanwhile, you can heat the bread in the oven or in a toaster.
Cut open the buns or flatbread and add the jackfruit plus the other veggies (sliced tomato, cucumber, cabbage, lettuce), and the vegan yogurt sauce. Sprinkle with red pepper flakes and enjoy!
Notes
Jackfruit alternative: You can use soy curls (textured soy protein) instead of jackfruit. You will also have to soak them in hot water and after 15 minutes drain and squeeze out as much water as possible. Another alternative would be to use oyster mushrooms.
Marinade: I recommend marinating the jackfruit for a few hours (or even overnight). 15 minutes is the minimum.
Dairy-Free Yogurt: Any yogurt is fine, e.g. soy yogurt, coconut yogurt, etc. You can also use Vegan Sour Cream and simply add a little water to thin it.
Bread: I used these homemade Gluten-Free Bread Rolls and simply shaped them into larger buns.
Tomato Sauce: You can use BBQ sauce instead.

Hi, not for this recipe. You can use textured soy protein or oyster mushrooms, as mentioned in the recipe notes.

Ingredients:
250 g bread flour
25 mL lukewarm water
1 1/2 tbsp sugar
1 tsp instant yeast
80 â€“ 90 mL coconut milk
1 tbsp margarine/butter, melted
1 egg, lightly beaten
a pinch of salt
_ Filling:_ 
Cakalang Pampis/Spicy Tuna Floss
Pastry Makers][4] 
I bought a box of pastry makers long time ago at a dollar store
Methods: 
1\. Add sugar into 25 mL luke warm water and sprinkle the yeast over. Let stand for 5 minutes or until its foamy.
2\. In a bowl mix flour and make hole in the centre. Add egg, butter and yeast mixture, knead while pouring in coconut milk a little at a time until the dough elastic and not sticking to the bowl and hand.
3\. Shape batter into large balls and put into a bowl covered with a damp napkin or a piece of plastic. Leave for 1-2 hours in a warm place until the dough rises.
4\. Punch the dough and start to stir with hand again, divide by 10 â€“ 15 and make balls. Let stand for 15 minutes.
5\. Roll each piece 1/2 cm thick. Put over the pastry maker. Make sure that the pastry dough is slightly larger than the pastry maker.
6\. Put a tablespoonful of filling on the center. Slowly fold the pastry maker and then press a bit firmly to seal the edges. Open carefully halfway and take out your panada. Repeat until you finished all. Let stand for 15 minutes and pinch the edge one more time with a fork, so the filling will not be popping out before deep fry.
7\. Fry them. Do not use very hot oil but medium heat to deep fry so the skin still smooth without bubbles.

Apparently there are really quite some Indo foods that I have no idea about ;), I am not that into tuna, maybe that's the reason why I have never heard of these savoury snacks before. Those look pretty though, I would maybe change the filling with something else, like chicken or beef.

Surely, you can substitute for chicken or beef.
I have been looking for more information about East Indonesian dishes. I found out that we actually have some kind of sashimi dish from Ternate, Gohu Ikan. It's very closed to ceviche. Enriched with calamansi, chili, shallot, lemon basil and coconut oil.

I love empanadas and like to fill them with all sorts of crazy non-traditional things! I love the sound of this, with the tuna and the coconut!

I adore Jamaican patties so I have no doubt I would love these. I had no idea they even made presses like that. I need to get my hands on one. They came out perfectly!

Your panadas look so pretty! I love empanadas, too! I actually made some last month for a Spanish-themed dinner party at home. I made them with ground beef. Your tuna filling sounds delish! By the way, I didn't know they have empanada makersâ€¦

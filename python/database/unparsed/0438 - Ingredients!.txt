Ingredients to make NO BAKE BREAKFAST BITES
Cinnamon (lots)
Gluten Free Oats or your favorite gluten free or grain free cereal
Nut Butter or Sunflower seed butter
Honey or Maple Syrup
Vanilla
Vanilla Protein powder or peanut flour (Collagen protein or egg white protein also works for those looking for a paleo option)
Almond flour
Need nut substitutes? Don’t you worry, I have that covered in the recipe notes below!
HOW TO MAKE CINNAMON VANILLA PROTEIN BREAKFAST BITES
Simple, grab your favorite vanilla protein powder, combine it with your favorite gluten free cereal/oats, and then roll it all together with cinnamon and nut butter. OR you can blend it all together (minus the honey) in a food processor then transfer that batter into a large bowl and add honey. Mix and roll!

In the video below (sorry it’s an oldie but goodie), you will see I have several options for the gluten free cereal base. Oats, rice crisps, gluten free Chex cereal, banana chips, etc. Whatever works, as long as you get a good base “meal/flour.” You can do that by using gluten free oats or by grinding up your cereal/granola. See above.
Either way, then end result is a batch of extremely delicious breakfast bites! Similar to taste to that of a cinnamon bun.. okay not really, more like a snickerdoodle meets oatmeal cookie. Still good for breakfast, in my opinion.

Let me know what you think of the video or if you have any questions about these no-bake breakfast protein bites! There are lots of easy substitutes if need be. Oh and be sure to use a CREAMY nut butter that stirs easy. That’s crucial! 
Now, let’s continue this whole breakfast with protein talk…
How can I get protein for breakfast (other than eggs)?
It’s important that all of us eat a good amount of breakfast protein – it helps to kickstart the body into action for the day. The thing is, not everyone likes or can eat eggs, so I like to have options to offer for good egg-free sources of protein for breakfast. Obviously, the Cinnamon Vanilla Breakfast Protein bites are a high-protein source, but here are a few more high-protein breakfast ideas:
Non-soy protein powder – I like to add it to smoothies. Try my Creamy Coconut Spirulina Superfood Smoothie or Orange Probiotic Immunity Boosting Smoothies.
Quinoa – It’s super delicious anytime, but one of my favorite ways to eat quinoa is in this Creamy Vegan Pumpkin Quinoa Breakfast.
Nut butter – Peanut butter, almond, cashew, walnut – choose your favorite! Load it up onto apple slices, schmear it onto gluten-free toast, or make these Dark Chocolate Almond Butter Breakfast Cookies.
Alright, I think we are fully ready to tackle a protein rich breakfast! Ready to make and NO BAKE?

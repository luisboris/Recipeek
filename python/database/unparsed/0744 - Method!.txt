Instructions
Preparation for falafel
Wash and soak chickpeas for overnight or at least for 6 hours. 
Discard the water and rinse them well. Drain them to a colander.
Process together chickpeas, cumin, coriander, pepper, cayenne, salt, onion, garlic, parsley and flour to a coarse mixture. 
The mixture must resemble wheat semolina or couscous.
If the mixture is not processed well the balls can break in the oil. Refrigerate for an hour if possible. 
Heat oil in a deep pan just enough to half immerse the falafel. 
The trick i found to prevent the falafels from disintegrating is to use oil just enough to half immerse them.
Optional : Make a very small ball and drop it in the hot oil to check if it is binding well. It should not break or fall apart. 
If it breaks, then add more flour or process the mixture a bit more.
Frying falafel
Make lemon sized balls and press them gently to bind the mixture well. 
If you have added flour then you may slightly flatten them.
Gently slide them one after the other to the hot oil. Do not disturb them for a minute or two. 
Deep fry them on a medium flame until golden & crisp. Remove the falafel to a steel colander or kitchen towel. 
Serve falafel with favorite dip or as a stuffing in pita bread or wraps.
For serving
To make tahini sauce – I used ¾ cup tahini, ¼ cup + 2 tbsp warm water, 2 large garlic cloves, 2 tbsp. lemon juice, salt as needed, 2 tsp finely chopped fresh parsley. Process all the ingredients in a processor until pale, creamy and thick
To make a quick yogurt dip, use ¾ cup greek yogurt or hung curd, 1 tsp lemon juice, salt, 1 garlic clove, deseeded green chili (optional). Blend them and add parsley.

Notes
I make falafel always without flour and it never disintegrates while frying. If you are keen to make them without flour, then you may need to experiment to get the correct texture of the dough (not very coarse and not fine).

hello
in your recipes 1 cup is 240ml, does that mean fill a 240ml cup to full amount with the ingredients you state in recipe?
e.g. 1 cup chick pea means fill a 240ml cup with chick peas, or if recipe states 1 cup semolina flour, fill a 240ml cup with semolina, 1 cup rice, fill the 240ml cup with rice etc
please explain 
thanks

Hi Dee, 
Yes you are right. If I say 1 cup xyz, you need to measure xyz with 240 ml cup. Same for tablespoon (15 ml) and teaspoon (5 ml) as well. This also applies for liquid ingredients. Hope this clears

I don’t have a food processor right now. So, I bought some chickpea flour and plan to mix just enough water in the recipe to make it bind. Do you think it will work?

Hi Rizwana, 
Yes you can use dhaniya. For the chickpeas, 1 cup dried chickpeas will make about 2.5 cups soaked, a little more or less. Even if you have not used 2 cups dried chickpeas, it is still fine. Just cut down the cumin approximately. Hope this helps.

Hi there! thanks so much for this amaizing recipe. I have a doubt about the nutritional information. is it 190 cal per ball? and how many falafels would you serve per person? Thanks!

Hi Cecilia, 
You are welcome. It is 92 cal per ball. I rechecked it. You can serve about 4 per person. Regarding the nutrition: it is just an approximation as the amount of oil that is absorbed by falafel is unknown. So I just calculated that each falafel absorbs about 1 tsp oil. About half a cup for the entire recipe but actually they do not absorb so much oil. So they may be lesser than 92 cal. Hope this helps.

Hi Swasti, I’m very glad I found this recipe. I’m such a huge fan of falafels and have always imagined making them must be tedious. But not so anymore though. It’s much similar to our parupu vada. Very excited to try this though. In the recipe you have mentioned this can be baked instead of frying. how do you bake them? For how long? Do you sprinkle oil on top etc. Pls can you share those details. Thank you.

Hi Ambika 
You are welcome. Yes similar to the paruppu vada. Yes I bake these at 220 C in a preheated oven for 12 to 15 mins. I flatten the balls a bit, not much otherwise they will fall apart, grease a wire rack with oil and then place these over the rack and bake. After 12 to 15 mins, I brush them lightly with oil or ghee and then flip and bake for another 4 to 5 mins Hope this helps.

Hi Swasthi, 
I have tried this falafel recipe a couple of months back. It turned out really delicious. Now I would like to bake it. In response to Ambika you have written that you baked those at 220 C in a pre heated oven. My questions are 
1\. what temperature I should set for preheating? I will bake in convection oven. 
2\. Should I use the lower rack or upper? 
3\. Should I directly place the patty on the rack or use the baking plate which comes with oven? 
4\. Can we replace Kabuli chana with the brown one?
Thanks in advance for answering all our questions with so much patience. You’re really a boon for us. 
Stay blessed.

Hi Tanu, 
You are welcome. Glad to know! Preheat at 220 C. You can do any either on the rack or a tray. If you think the mixture didn’t bind well or looks too delicate then a tray works better otherwise they may crack or fall apart. I bake them in the middle rack. I haven’t tried with brown chana. But should work. Hope this helps

Hi Annie 
you can use. However falafel is made using soaked & uncooked chickpeas. But can chickpeas are cooked. you may need to add more flour or bread crumbs when you process them as they turn mushy and sticky. The taste too differs. But the recipe works

I”m going to try your recipe it looks properly spiced and the last time I made homemade falafel with a different recipe I used canned, ab DS boy did that not work out great…. Dissolved in hot oil ? not good eats btw.

Yes do try. Anytime before you fry the entire batch, just fry one to check if it dissolves. If it does, add more flour or bread crumbs to the mixture..

Hi. I am not sure anyone mentioned it but it would be helpful if you indicate if rhe 2 cups of chickpeas is dry/uncooked or tinned/cooked. I used 1 cup cooked chickpeas (I only wanted to make a small batch) but after mixing everything it looks like I can only make 4 lemon sized balls. So I think you meant here 2 cups of dry/uncooked chickpeas. Thanks!

Hi Lesleen 
Yes it is 2 cups of raw or dry chickpeas. 
Falafel taste best with soaked chickpeas not cooked ones. 
Since I have given the recipe from scratch – soaking etc. It is dry chickpeas otherwise I would mention soaked chickpeas and would skip the step of soaking them. Thanks for the mention. I will update it more clearly.

Instructions
For the soup
In a large skillet, heat 2 tablespoons of sunflower oil over medium heat and saut√© the mushrooms for 5 minutes, stirring very regularly.
In a large pot over medium-low heat, melt the butter and add the remaining 4 tablespoons of sunflower oil.
Stir in the flour until the mixture turns slightly browns.
Add the broth and beat a few seconds with a whisk.
Add the potatoes, mushrooms, caraway, bay leaves and allspice. Cover and cook until the potatoes are tender, about 15 minutes.
Remove the bay leaves and allspice. Add the cream.
Cook for 1 minute, stirring constantly.
Season with salt and pepper and add the dill, sugar and 3 tablespoons of vinegar.
For the poached quail eggs
Open each quail egg on the most curvy part of the egg with the tip of a knife, being careful not to pierce the yolk.
Pour the eggs into a small bowl and add 3 tablespoons white vinegar.
Set aside at room temperature for 5 minutes.
Bring a pot of salted water to a boil.
Create a swirl with a whisk and drop the eggs one by one into the whirlpool.
Cook each egg for 1 minute and cool immediately by placing in a large volume of ice water.
Serve each bowl of kulajda with 2 poached quail eggs on top.

Well, yes Eva. Maybe there are different versions of kulajda‚Ä¶ but there are versions with quail eggs. Let me give you just one example from the menu of a Czech restaurant in Prague: https://www.vzatisi.cz/en/menu/a-la-carte/

Well, maybe Eva and my family grew up on the more austere side of the tracks. Likely, they never got into a formal dining restaurant, certainly never when in the old country.

My father had a Doctorate in Chemical Engineering and was one of the few who could leave the country during the communists days. We ate at a lot of upscale restaurants, such as they were back then. It was considered decadent to emulate any western ways, and that enforced a certain ‚Äúbasic‚Äù aspect to traditional Czech cuisine. No shrimp was eaten, and neither would anyone touch Lobster, though the question remains as to where on earth one would obtain Lobster. Oranges were a delicacy that only those who were allowed to shop at Tuzeks could hope to score one or twice a year. Kids used to share bubble-gum. 
Of course nowadays you can find most things that can be consumed. I‚Äôm sure that the Vietnamese food in Bohemia is fantastic. 
But traditional Czech Cuisine? I though that by definition the term predates the velvet revolution.

You still don‚Äôt know where lobsters exist? Then you must not know that lobster was the cheapest, poorest food for servants in areas where it is common. And, in many regions, oranges grow on trees so much that even homeless beggers can eat them if nothing else. It seems like communism succeeded in being a truly isolating, mind-altering cult.
But I do still wonder how quail eggs become common. There‚Äôs always something new to learn.

I noticed that as well. My parents and grandparents would never hunt down quail eggs. That would have been considered decadent. In North Western Bohemia for sure,, here were chicken eggs, or Duck eggs. That‚Äôs it. all. The use of Sunflower oil is possible, but I never saw it in any kitchen that I remember. It seems that lard was used most of the time.
Perhaps this is an ancient Czech dish from 1992? üòâ Things do change.

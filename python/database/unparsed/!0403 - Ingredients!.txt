Ingredients & Substitutions
Extra Firm Tofu – Look for _extra-firm_ tofu that is not water-packed, such as Trader Joe’s High-Protein Tofu or Super Firm Sprouted Tofu. These types of tofu do not have excess water and do not need to be pressed. If you have to use water-packed tofu make sure to press as much water as you can out of it first by using a tofu pressor a weighted, towel-lined cutting board.
Marinade – This is a combination of soy sauce, rice vinegar, maple syrup, sesame oil, and fresh ginger.
Oil – Any high-heat oil will do like coconut or avocado.
Vegan Mayonnaise – My favorite brand is Just Mayo. It is shelf-stable and has a similar price point to non-vegan mayonnaise. However, any vegan mayo will do.
Hoisin Sauce
Sriracha
Agave Nectar
Quick Pickled Veggies – A combination of carrots, cucumbers, jalapeños, granulated sugar, rice vinegar, and salt.
Pizza Dough \- I typically buy pre-made pizza dough which can be found in the refrigerated section of most well-stocked grocery stores. When baked, it tastes as fresh as if made in your kitchen while eliminating a time-consuming step in homemade pizza. However, feel free to make pizza dough from scratch or buy par-baked pizza dough.
Cilantro
Jalapeño
Recommended Equipment
For this recipe you will need a large, shallow dish for marinating the tofu, a large skillet, a chef’s knife, cutting board, a pizza stone and pizza cutter and basic kitchen utensils. _( <<affiliate links)_

How to Make Vegan Banh mi Pizza
Step One – Prepare the Tofu
The first step is swapping out the Vietnamese meat for marinated tofu.
I used extra firm tofu that is pressed and marinated in a mixture of soy sauce, sesame oil, hoisin sauce, and rice vinegar for a classic Vietnamese taste. Let the flavors soak into the tofu for at least an hour.
Cut tofu into ¼″ slices and pan-fried it in hot oil for that chewy, crispy texture.

Step Two – Quick Pickled Vegetables
Thinly slice the carrots, cucumbers, and jalapeños. Whisk them together with the rice vinegar, sugar, and salt. Cover and refrigerate until ready to use.
For this recipe, I omitted the daikon because they can be difficult to find and I like to keep my recipes as simple as possible. However, if you can find daikon at your local grocery store, feel free to add that in with the carrots and the cucumber for a more authentic vegetable mix.

Step Three – Creamy Banh Mi Sauce
Lastly, make the creamy Banh mi sauce.
The Bahn mi fusion brings together Vietnamese flavors with French condiments. A combination of vegan mayonnaise, soy sauce, hoisin sauce, and Sriracha (or jalapeños) are whipped up into a spicy, tangy, creamy, and oh-so-delicious sauce that will have you licking your fingers for more.

Step Four - Assemble the Pizza
For the recipe, the crust gets baked separately. Stretch out the crust and bake it in a hot oven for about 15 minutes, until the edges are lightly brown. Once the crust is out of the oven, slather it in Banh mi sauce and top it with quick-pickled vegetables, sautéed tofu, jalapeños, and cilantro.
Serve immediately.

Serving And Storing
Serve pizza fresh out of the oven.
Store leftover pizza in an airtight container in the refrigerator 1-2 days. Gently reheat the pizza in the oven or on the stovetop before eating.

Instructions
1. Preheat the oven to 190C / 375F and line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
2. Heat the 1 tablespoon olive oil in a frying pan on medium low heat. Add the leeks and saute for 5 minutes or until they begin to soften. Add the garlic and green onions and cook for another few minutes until they too soften.
3. Next add the thawed spinach, dill, rosemary, salt and pepper. If you're using the vegan feta, now is the time to add it. 
4. Continue to cook this mixture for a few minutes to allow any residual moisture to evaporate. Taste and adjust seasoning as necessary.
5. At this point the filling can be set aside or used right away. To make the triangles take one sheet of filo and brush it lightly with some olive oil. Lay another layer of dough on top and bush it lightly with olive oil. Finally add a the last layer of filo, and brush it lightly with oil (this makes three layers total).
6. Take the three layered piece of filo and cut it into 4 strips along the long edge. Working quickly (so the filo doesn't dry out too much) add around 3 tablespoons of spinach filling to one strip and begin to fold up like a triangle. If you're having trouble with the folding see the video above.
7. Continue in this manner until all the filling is used. Once you have around 12 triangles, brush them one more time with a little olive oil and sprinkle with sesame seeds. 
8. Bake for 25-30 minutes or until golden and crisp. Serve warm.

1. Combine all of the ingredients in a large bowl. Cover and refrigerate to marinate, at least four hours, preferably overnight.

These look so good…. I’ve never worked with phyllo dough but I feel very inspired to try. It can’t be worse than rice paper rolls haha! ;)

Hi Ailim, I’m so sorry about the delay. Sophie (the author of this post) is unavailable to comment right now, but I thought I could share some insight. My best guess is to form the triangles ahead of time, but don’t bake them. Arrange them in a single layer and seal tightly in a container. You can also freeze them this way, as well. I would bake the frozen (do not thaw) pastries as above. They make take a few minutes longer. I hope this helps! Again, we’re really sorry to delay our response on this for you.

Hi Sophie, I clicked the link for how to fold the triangles and the link sent me to an image logo for alldomains.com. Any chance you can check the link so I can see how to fold the phyllo? Thanks so much!

These look so good! I’m Greek so we have these all the time but I have never seen them with the seeds on top – such a great addition! I will have to try that for my next batch :)

Instructions
In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, combine the eggs and sugar. Beat for about 15 minutes at medium speed until white and fluffy.
Add the ground hazelnuts, ground almonds, finely chopped candied orange peel, finely chopped citrus peel, gingerbread spice and lemon zest. Whisk until combined then cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let the batter rest in the fridge overnight or for at least 10 hours.
Preheat the oven to 320° F (160° C), line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
Scoop the mixture with a spoon or an ice cream scoop onto the wafers (Oblaten) and smooth down the top until the very edge of the wafer with a wet knife. The dough should be thicker in the center and thinner on the edges. Set them on the lined sheet.
Bake for about 22 minutes, or until the Lebkuchen are set but still soft in the middle and have barely started to brown around the edges. Leave them on the tray to cool down completely.
Once the Lebkuchen are cooled, place a wire rack over a baking sheet (to catch the drippings). Dip the Lebkuchen in the chocolate glaze and let the excess drip back into the bowl. Then place the Lebkuchen on the wire rack. Let them dry completely and store them in an airtight container.

Thanks for this recipe! I used it to make an almost vegan recipe: 1/2 c each honey and molasses, 2 c each almond and hazelnut meal, 1/2 c each (still wet from cooking) candied orange and lemon peel, 4 T flaxseed meal, 2 T Lebkuchengewurtz (spice mix), 1 t vanilla, pinch of salt. Blended the wet ingredients in the food processor, then mixed with the dry and followed your directions. Glazed with rum and powdered sugar. So good!

When I first ready your recipe, it reminded me of fruit cake which I hate. Then I saw that my local Aldi store was selling packaged Lebkuchen cookies for Christmas. I tried both the sugar and chocolate glazed. The chocolate glazed were amazing. So, I tried your recipe, I found the following on Amazon; the Candied (Glazed) Orange Peel Dices and Küchle Back-Oblaten, Ground almonds & ground hazelnuts. I also found the Diced Citron candied peels, and lebkuchen spice.(super simple with everything right there. Making it by scratch was even more tasty than the Aldi version. Next time I will use your recipe for Lebkuchen spice but I was in a hurry to make before Christmas. Fantastic recipe!

I live with my Oma and was also able to live in Germany for a couples years when I was younger. I love these cookies so much and they are so hard to get where we live. They used to carry them on base during Christmas time but the past few years stopped carrying them. I decided to try and make them myself this year and found your recipe. Man am I happy I tried it! It’s definitely not hard to make but the ingredients were somewhat hard to find. And grinding up everything is a labor of love for sure. I used your spice mix recipe as well…perfection! Thanl you for this great recipe, I will continue to use it. Oma approved of it too mmmmmm mmmm!!

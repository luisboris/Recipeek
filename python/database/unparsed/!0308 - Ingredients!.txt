Ingredients
Overnight Sponge:
1/2 cup sourdough starter
1 tablespoon honey
1 cup milk (you can use water, but milk makes them more tender)
2 cup whole wheat flour (I've used white whole wheat, whole wheat pastry flour, spelt, and half regular whole wheat + half all purpose - using only regular whole wheat tends to make them heavier.)
For the Muffins:
1½ teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon sea salt
1/2 cup whole wheat flour (you may need a bit more during kneading)

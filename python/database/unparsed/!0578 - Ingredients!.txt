INGREDIENTS
Rice porridge
Butter
200 ml water
160g /200ml porridge rice
1 litre milk of your choice
0,5 teaspoon salt
In a heavy-based pot, melt the butter and add rice and water. Bring it to bubble, mix well and then adjust to low heat for a few minutes to let the rice soak in the water. Add salt and milk of your choice. Cover the pot with a lid and let the porridge simmer for 50 minutes. While cooking the fruit sauce, mix the porridge every so often to not let it stick to the bottom.
Fruity All Sorts Sauce
10-12 dried plums
6 dried apricots
2 tablespoon of dried raisins
4 dried apples
40g sugar
340g water / 400 ml
1 whole clove
1 small star anis
1 tablespoon of potato starch + 43g/50 ml cold water
touch of cognac or choice of your liquor
Prepare the fruits (100-130g depending how thick & crowded you want the sauce). Slice the plums in two, dice the dried apricots and apples. Transfer the fruits into cold water with spices. Bring the mix to boil and then adjust to a low heat. Cook the dried fruits for 20-30 minutes until soft. Remove the spices and add liquor of your choice. Prepare the starchy mixture with cold water. Add the mixture into the fruit sauce in a steady motion while stirring it in simultaneously. Let the sauce bubble once more and then set aside. If not served immediately, stir the fruit sauce couple of times while cooling to avoid the clingy top layer.

Since photographing these two servings, I have cooked rice porridge twice already. It really is a heartwarming classic to enjoy throughout winter and not just as a Christmas day treat. I hope you enjoy this tradition and try out the fruity _sekametelisoppa_! 
_Love, Saara_

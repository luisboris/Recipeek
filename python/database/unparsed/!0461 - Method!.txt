Instructions
For the Scented Sugar Syrup:
Add the sugar, water and lemon juice to a medium, thick-bottomed saucepan, and bring to a boil over medium heat, giving the pan an occasional swirl and skimming off any foam on the surface.
Turn heat down slightly and boil 2 minutes, swirling the pan occasionally. (The syrup will thicken more upon cooling.)
Turn off heat and stir in the orange blossom water or rose water; cool to room temperature, then use.
For the Cake:
Preheat oven to 3750F (1900C); brush the tahini on the inside of a 10-inch (25 cm) round baking pan.
Whisk together the semolina, baking powder, salt, sugar, and coconut in a large bowl. Stir in the butter and milk until combined.
Transfer the batter to the prepared pan and spread it out evenly; let it sit for 10 minutes.
Score the batter into 1-inch (2.5-cm) square or diamond shapes with a sharp knife, periodically dipping the knife in hot water and drying it off before continuing to score the batter; place 1 almond in the center of each diamond.
Bake until the sides and top are golden brown, about 30 minutes. (If the sides are brown but the top isn’t, you can broil the cake for a couple minutes to brown the top.)
Once out of the oven, cut the cake along the lines you scored. Slowly pour the cooled syrup onto the hot cake. Let the cake sit at room temperature 2 hours to absorb the syrup before serving.
Helpful Tips
Recipe adapted from the recipe for Coconut Semolina Cake (Harissa) in my cookbook, _An Edible Mosaic: Middle Eastern Fare with Extraordinary Flair_ (Tuttle Publishing; Nov. 2012).
The Scented Sugar Syrup can be flavored with vanilla instead of rose water or orange blossom water if you prefer.
Cool the Scented Sugar Syrup to room temperature before using, since this allows the syrup to thicken.
When you pour the Scented Sugar Syrup onto the cake, the cake should be hot (right out of the oven) and the syrup should be cool, so that the cake fully absorbs the syrup.

Layla, Thank you so much for catching that! The coconut gets added in Step 2 under “For the Cake”. I updated the recipe above.

I’m always looking for better ways of using cornmeal…and this one certainly has success written all over it. I also like Brandy’s idea of using orange blossom ;o) 
Great baking ingredients make for a lovely cake formula. Well done Faith.
Ciao for now and flavourful wishes, 
Claudia

Funny story about this pumpkin cheesecake...it's b ![Funny story about this pumpkin cheesecake...it's been on my blog since 2018, but this year I wanted to remake it in the Instant Pot to see how it would turn out. So I figured, why not retake the photos and update the post while I'm at it, right? \(foodbloggers, I know you get it! 😁\)
So I made it in the IP, and as the lovely bakers say on The Great British Baking Show, "it was a disaster!" 😟😨😩 Not really, but the top wasn't so pretty; it had craters like a giant circle of swiss cheese \(swipe through to see it\).
I was bummed because I had high hopes! And then Dan suggested frosting. Hmmm, on a cheesecake?! It turns out, he was right. It was delicious. 🥰
This lowcarb pumpkin cheesecake is topped with a velvety smooth cream cheese frosting that compliments the flavor of the cake perfectly. And it looks SO elegant! I'm telling you, if I can pipe frosting like this, you DEFINITELY can! \(Step-by-step photos of the process are on my blog.\)
Make this in the IP or in the oven, and wow your guests with it on Thanksgiving. And bonus, each slice only has 3g net carbs per serving! 🥳

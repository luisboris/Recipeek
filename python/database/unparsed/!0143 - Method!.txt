Instructions
1. With an oven rack in the middle position, preheat oven to 375 degrees Fahrenheit. Pour ¼ cup of the olive oil into a large, rimmed baking sheet and turn until the pan is evenly coated.
2. In a food processor, combine the soaked and drained chickpeas, onion, parsley, cilantro, garlic, salt, pepper, cumin, cinnamon, and the remaining 1 tablespoon of olive oil. Process until smooth, about 1 minute.
3. Using your hands, scoop out about 2 tablespoons of the mixture at a time. Shape the falafel into small patties, about 2 inches wide and ½ inch thick. Place each falafel on your oiled pan.
4. Bake for 25 to 30 minutes, carefully flipping the falafels halfway through baking, until the falafels are deeply golden on both sides. These falafels keep well in the refrigerator for up to 4 days, or in the freezer for several months.
Notes
_Adapted fromThe America’s Test Kitchen Healthy Family Cookbook._
Make-ahead option: I haven’t tried this, but the original recipe notes that the uncooked falafel patties can be refrigerated on a parchment-lined baking sheet, wrapped tightly in plastic wrap, for up to 2 hours before baking.
How to double this recipe: Preheat the oven with two oven racks near the center of the oven. Double all of the ingredients. If you have a large food processor (guessing 11+ cup capacity), you can mix all of the ingredients at once. Use two baking sheets, and swap their positions (top to bottom, bottom to top) when you flip the falafel halfway through baking.
Recommended equipment: I love my 11-cup food processor (affiliate link).

Wow, I tried your recipe for the first time and these falafels are amazing. I doubled the recipe. The fisrt ones I ate were in a pita with romain lettuce and plain greek yogourt. It might seems plain, for a pita sandwich, but it was soooo tasty! Thank you!

Hi Kate, 
I made a trip to Whole Foods last night to buy dry organic chickpeas. I had never used them before. I soaked them for 19hrs in the refrigerator. I made the Falafel tonight for dinner. DELISH!! The mixture was nice and moist and when i flipped them not a single one fell apart. The taste was great! I now can enjoy Falafel more often at home. Thank you so much.

I would “feel awful” if I didn’t write a 5-star review for these crispy nuggets. I made them exactly as the recipe calls for. I was a bit worried that the patties were too moist when forming them, but they turned out GREAT after baking. I left them in the back of the oven a bit longer to brown properly…like 5 minutes or so. They are perfectly crispy and SO much better for a salad than the hard, fried versions. Awesome, light and full of flavor..!

I’ve had fantastic luck with this recipe (thanks Kate!) with canned chickpeas + a bit of chickpea flour to help dry out the mixture. I can go from plugging in the food processor to sliding a tray in the oven in less than 10 minutes. No soaking (or advance planning) needed!

Wouldn’t olive oil used to grease the pan burn? Not recommended to expose olive oil to extreme heat I believe. Maybe sunflower oil is ok since it will only coat the outer parts of the patties.

Hi, I love the way the falafels are fried on the oiled baking sheet. I haven’t been sticking strictly to this recipe, but applying the idea of adding enough oil to the mixture and the baking sheet plus a lot of fresh herbs makes a big difference with any recipe. I’ve got four kids so not frying them the traditional way saves so much time, oil and nerves. :)

Wow! Great falafel. I made it this recipe for dinner tonight and the falafel came out perfectly — firm and tasty. I had my doubts when, half-way through cooking, they were still pretty moist and floppy and hard to flip over, but I ended up baking them about 10 minutes longer than the suggested time and they came out golden and perfect. Thanks for another delicious recipe.

Hi Kate! These were excellent! Falafel is my favorite food and I have never attempted to make it. The flavor was amazing and I will for sure being making this again and again. I do have a question, however. I soaked my chickpeas for 8 hours and when I formed the patties I had a hard time getting them to stick together and flipping them was tricky. Perhaps, I made the mixture too wet somehow? I love this recipe and can’t wait to make it again so any advice would be greatly appreciated!!

My husband doesn’t like cilantro, so the first time we just used more parsley and the second time substituted dill; both were delicious! Thank you!

I’ve probably left a comment about these before, but just in case – folks, you will NEVER try and make falafels from those store bought mixes again. I’m all for convenience but I always found falafels kind of “meh” or I’d eat them the first day when fresh but find them gross the next day. THESE are gorgeous, fresh, delicious little balls of protein and happiness that are truly a gift. I am about to make a second batch now that my parsley has come in (survived through the winter in this Ontario, Canada garden)!

As I was shaping these and putting on the pan I really thought they were a total write-off. I was so wrong though! The mixture was quite wet after blending. I even tried to add a bit of chickpea flour. As I put them in the oven I figured that they’d fall to pieces when I flipped then and I’d end up with falafel crumble, but I was pleasantly surprised that they were firm when I flipped them. They turned out crispy on both sides with good flavor. I’ve been proven wrong! I may have soaked my chickpeas too long, so will soak for a shorter amount of time on the next try. I’ll also add that the first time I made these I didn’t have soaked chickpeas so made them with canned plus some chickpea flour. They came out “OK”, but I can tell the difference with using soaked chickpeas this time around.

Hi Kate, 
Last time I tried to make these the felafel fell apart, but this time I paid closer attention to your method and they worked out very well – held their shape and baked well. I had doubled the recipe (with some guesswork about the volume of chick peas as I soaked a whole packet full) and had to blend it quite a while in the food processor before it got smooth enough (not what I would call smooth – just less rough). Thank you! Great not to have to deep-fray.

This healthy falafel using uncooked garbanzos is amazing. It has a nice mild flavor, but would use more parsley and less cilantro next time, and increase the herbs a bit.
A blender or bona fide food processor would work a lot better than my wand blender really which struggled with the beans. I placed parchment paper on the baking sheet and reduced the amount of oil to 2 Tablespoons. I think I could have used even less and still gotten the golden brown color. I served them on pita with tzatziki sauce… perfect!

I was shocked at how easy and delicious these were. I must admit I was skeptical because how could a healthy baked version be as good as the traditional fried one? It really is! 
I read many of the comments and found the tips helpful. I soaked the chickpeas 18 hours, I added a tbsp of fresh lemon juice and increased the added olive oil from 1 tbsp to 2. Once everything was buzzed in the food processor I stuck it in the fridge for ½ hour while I made the Miso and Tahini sauce (also a winner). I used convection bake for extra crispiness. I had no problem with them holding together and they didn’t fall apart when turned, used a scooper and parchment paper. Thank you for the great recipes!

I managed to make these perfectly with canned chickpeas – just added 2 tsp of cornstarch to hold it together a bit more. Also I didn’t have cilantro or parsley on hand but used near equal amounts of mixed spice, paprika, cinnamon, ginger, sage, moroccan seasoning with black pepper and salt. soooo yummy!!

Hey Kate! My chickpeas have been soaking already for about 15 hours, and they are really hard still! Like marbles. They have doubled in size, but I am worried they will be too tough. Usually when I cook with dried chickpeas I cook them first… Are they supposed to be this hard still?

I love this recipe. Made several times. I do not have a way to get to grocer but once per month. I have lighthouse freeze dried cilantro and dried parsley. Can I use these in lieu of Fresh? It so would 2 1/2 Tablespoon each be equivalent or need more?

I haven’t tried with dried, so I can’t say for sure. Sorry! If you try, please let me know what you think.

Mine all fell apart during baking :( They still tasted good, although were a little dry and very crumbly. Any idea what I may have done wrong? 
I soaked the chickpeas for about 15 hours…they were still pretty hard when I put in the food processor

Hi! Defrost in the refrigerator for food safety and you can gently reheat oven, stove or microwave.

These were phenomenal! I recommend soaking the chickpeas for no less than 24 hours. I’ve made these twice (first time soaked for only 8 hours, second time 24 hours) and the 24 hours one were much better. I also increased the olive oil in the mix a little bit the second time and added some fresh lemon juice and cut down the cinnamon a smidge. Love these, will be making them again!

Great method, these turned out excellent! 
I spiced them differently (personal taste) and I added some baking soda to the soaking water to soften them further. A 24 hour soak is best, makes a big difference. 
Thank you for another fantastic recipe.

Don’t think I can go back to store bought falafels after this. Great flavour and never dry! I like to make them a little bigger and use them as burger patties

Parsley can be a good alternative to cilantro. I hope your family loves them!

If the mix is too loose:mix in some liquid from a tinned chick peas…it acts as a binding.

Found this recipe today and tried it. One of the best falafel recipes I have made, worked perfectly. I was dubious of the cinnamon addition as I thought it might be overpowering (I also added some paprika) but I added it as the recipe suggests and found it created a good depth of flavour. I didn’t add all the oil on the tray, I used some baking paper and just brushed the paper with oil in the beginning and the falafel after turning half way. Still crispy enough for me without too much oil. 
Will definitely make again.

Hi Destiny, see step 1 and 2. You only need 1/4 cup + 1 tablespoon for a single recipe.

This falafel recipe was so yummy! Highly recommend adding garlic powder, onion powder, a little bit of cayenne pepper (decided to not add cinnamon), and juice of one lemon to the falafel mixture. My husband and I ate these in pitas with tzatziki sauce and pickled cucumbers and onions :p

Love this recipe. I have made falafels few times now and my family loves it. It is crispy and tasty. Could not believe that homemade falafels can be so good. We make falafel wraps every fortnight now. 
Could you help me know how to freeze them, thanks!!

Delicious! I’ve made this recipe 3 times already and bookmarked it for future reference. I’ve used a combo of whatever herbs are looking good in the garden, usually parsley, dill, and chives. I love falafel wrapped in warm flatbread with tzatziki, onions, tomato, and lettuce (+/- feta if I have some). Thanks for the recipe!

These are so great! I love that the recipe doubles or triples easily so my family can pack leftovers for lunch! A tip for others – if you forget to soak the beans ahead of time, use the instapot and cook on high pressure for 5 minutes then natural release. Voila! Presoaked beans!

I make these on a regular basis. I have yet to taste a better falafel (and I’ve been to many a falafel joint). I have even converted a few falafel haters with these. Highly highly recommend this recipe.

Oh my gosh Kate, so okay I made the crispy falafel and I have to say, “THEY ROCK !!! “. They’re so delicious and easy to make. I cook a lot of Lebanese food and this recipe is a must keep recipe. 
Thank you so much!

This falafel recipe has to be the best one I’ve ever made. We doubled the recipe for a little Football Sunday falafel party, and it was a huge hit and is so easy. I used dried and soaked chickpeas for the first time, and it was a game changer. They crisped up amazingly well in the oven and tasted great! We paired with homemade pita, pickled veggies, tzaztiki, tahini, and a salad. Highly recommend!

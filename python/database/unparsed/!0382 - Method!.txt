Instructions:
In a large sauté pan heat olive oil. Add the chopped onion, chopped cauliflower, crushed garlic and spices – curry, turmeric, coriander powder, salt and pepper. Cook while stirring occasionally about 5-7 minutes until the cauliflower slightly softens.
At the same time, cook the peas: in a small pot, put the peas with boiling water to cover. Bring to a second boil and continue cooking for 5 more minutes. Drain.
In a large mixing bowl, place the chickpea flour and a glass of water, and whisk well until smooth. Add the cooked cauliflower and onions, cooked peas, chopped coriander, salt and pepper, and mix well. The mixture is a bit liquidish and that’s fine.
In a skillet, heat oil for frying, about ¼-inch/ half a cm high. with your clean hands, form a 2-inch patty and carefully place it in the skillet. Repeat with the rest of the mixture until the frying pan is full. The patties will puff up so make sure not to overcrowd the pan and leave some space between the patties. Fry for 3 minutes on one side, turn carefully and fry the other side for another 2 minutes Transfer to plate with absorbent paper.
Serve hot or cold, preferably with side dressing (try it with yogurt and mint)
Notes:
Oil for frying – you can use any oil according to your preference. I use canola oil. The patties are quite tolerant of the amount of oil, but I think it is best to make half-deep frying for optimal results. You can also reduce the amount of oil if you insist, but then make sure to use a good non-stick skillet.
I love eating those patties with a dip on the side, for example- yogurt and mint, tahini, tomato salsa, garlic dill, any kind of pesto and so on.
When baking the patties, I add grounded flax seeds, which help the patties to come out firmer from the oven. Flax seeds are neutral in flavor and super healthy. It is best to store flax seeds in the freezer

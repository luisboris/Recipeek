Instructions
One day ahead: Pour the chickpeas into a large bowl and cover them by about 3 inches of cold water. Add 1/2 tsp of baking soda to the water and stir; this will help soften the chickpeas. Cover the bowl and let them soak overnight in a cool, dark place or in the refrigerator. The chickpeas should soak at least 12 hours and up to 24 hours, until tender (change soaking water for fresh water after 12 hours). They will double in size as they soak – you will have between 4 and 5 cups of beans after soaking.

Drain and rinse the chickpeas well. Pour them into your food processor along with the chopped onion, garlic cloves, parsley, flour or chickpea flour (use chickpea flour to make gluten free), salt, cumin, ground coriander, black pepper, cayenne pepper, and cardamom. Note : if you have a smaller food processor, you will want to divide the ingredients in half and process the mixture one batch at a time.

Pulse all ingredients together until a rough, coarse meal forms. Scrape the sides of the processor periodically and push the mixture down the sides. Process until the mixture is somewhere between the texture of couscous and a paste. You want the mixture to hold together, and a more paste-like consistency will help with that... but don't over-process, you don't want it turning into hummus!

Once the mixture reaches the desired consistency, pour it out into a bowl and use a fork to stir; this will make the texture more even throughout. Remove any large chickpea chunks that the processor missed.
Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate for 1-2 hours.
Fill a skillet with vegetable oil to a depth of 1 ½ inches. I prefer to use cooking oil with a high smoke point, like grapeseed. Heat the oil slowly over medium heat. The ideal temperature to fry falafel is between 360 and 375 degrees F; the best way to monitor the temperature is to use a deep fry or candy thermometer. After making these a few times, you will start to get a feel for when the oil temperature is "right."
Meanwhile, form falafel mixture into round balls or slider-shaped patties using wet hands or a falafel scoop. I usually use about 2 tbsp of mixture per falafel. You can make them smaller or larger depending on your personal preference. The balls will stick together loosely at first, but will bind nicely once they begin to fry.

If the balls won't hold together, place the mixture back in the processor again and continue processing to make it more paste-like. Keep in mind that the balls will be delicate at first; if you can get them into the hot oil, they will bind together and stick. If they still won't hold together, you can try adding 2-3 tbsp of flour or chickpea flour to the mixture. If they still won't hold, add 1-2 eggs to the mix. This should fix any issues you are having.
Before frying my first batch of falafel, I like to fry a test one in the center of the pan. If the oil is at the right temperature, it will take 2-3 minutes per side to brown (5-6 minutes total). If it browns faster than that, your oil is too hot and your falafels will not be fully cooked in the center. Cool the oil down slightly and try again.

When the oil is at the right temperature, fry the falafels in batches of 5-6 at a time until golden brown on both sides.

Once the falafels are fried, remove them from the oil using a slotted spoon.

Let them drain on paper towels. Serve the falafels fresh and hot; they go best with a plate of hummus and topped with creamy tahini sauce. You can also stuff them into a pita.

SESAME FALAFEL VARIATION : After forming the balls or patties, dip them in sesame seeds prior to frying. This will make the falafel coating crunchier and give it a slightly nutty flavor.

HERB FALAFEL VARIATION (GREEN FALAFEL) : Add ½ cup additional chopped green parsley, or cilantro, or a mixture of the two prior to blending.

TURMERIC FALAFEL (YELLOW FALAFEL) : Add ¾ tsp turmeric to the food processor prior to blending.

HOW TO MAKE A FALAFEL PITA : Making a falafel pita is actually really simple. The two main ingredients are pita bread and falafel. 
Cut the pita bread in half to form two “pockets.” Each pocket is a serving size. Stuff the pocket with falafel, as well as any add-ons you fancy.
Here are some traditional add-ons that can be added to your pita: tahini sauce, shredded lettuce, diced or sliced tomatoes, Israeli salad, onions, dill pickles, hummus, tabouli, french fries

I made this this morning. I followed the recipe closely except for a larger quantity of fresh parsley. 
The dough was stiff and easy to shape by hand. I froze most it after making about 65-70 walnut sized portions and I fried about a dozen right away in grape seed oil. My first thought was “These are good but there’s something missing.” More salt? More cayenne? But now that I’m dipping them in a nice tahini sauce I think they’re just perfect. 
This is the first time I’ve ever made falafel from scratch. Thanks for the recipe and the guidance!

Delish! I followed the recipe exactly. Added both the baking powder and soda. Used a tablespoon to make fat little football shapes. In the air fryer, baked at 350 for 10 minutes followed by 5 minutes on air fry (400). Came out perfect. Used a home made buffalo white bean hummus thinned down a bit as a dip. Everyone was very happy with them.

Oh my gosh I made these today and they are the best falafel I’ve ever had. My husband usually won’t eat them and he ended up snacking on them all day. I added more spices like other reviews said and think they tasted better with the baking powder. Thanks again for best recipe!!

If freezing the mixture, don’t add the baking soda. Instead, wait to add the baking soda until it after the mixture has thawed and you are ready to fry them.

I forgot the flour/chickpea flour by accident but formed the balls and lightly sprayed and cooked in the air fryer, these were awesome! Had three batches made and some to freeze. I season all batches after the first more aggressively also as mentioned by another. Mix your favorite hummus and with a. Little more tahini and lemon juice and blend with some seasoning and cucumber for a great sauce to pair!
Thank you for the recipe!

This recipe turned out great, so so yummy and more-ish! I had tried a falafel recipe prior to this and the mix literally disintegrated into the oil, so I’m really happy I have found a recipe that is foolproof! Will definitely be making again, love the look of the variations too! Thank you Tori 🙂

I made these again but baked them this time and they turned out great. Preheat oven to 375 F, oil the parchment paper plus oil the tops of the falafels, bake for about 30 minutes, flip them halfway through.
I spiced them more aggressively this time (personal taste) and I left them moister than I would for frying and it worked out well. For frying I have to add more flour or the centers remain raw, but for baking I don’t need to add much more flour.

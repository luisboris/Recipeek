Instructions
In a saucepan, boil ¬æ cup/200ml of water and add the sauerkraut. Cook on medium / low heat for 15 minutes.
At the same time, in a large pot, boil the potatoes in the remaining water. Season with salt and pepper and add the caraway seeds, bay leaves and whole allspice berries. Cook for 30 minutes over medium heat.
Once the potatoes are almost cooked, add the sauerkraut and cooking water and simmer over very low heat.
In a frying pan, melt the butter and brown the onions for two minutes. Add the bacon and sausage. Mix well and cook on medium heat for 5 minutes. Set aside.
Gently heat the milk, add the flour, whisk and pour the mixture into the pot and stir well.
Add the fried onion, sausage and bacon. Increase the heat to medium and cook for 15 minutes without stirring.
Turn off the heat and stir in the sour cream. Season with salt and pepper again.

This looks really delicious and I can‚Äôt wait to cook this at home tonight for the fam, but I‚Äôm not sure what ‚Äúwhole allspice berries‚Äù are, is it a common food item to find at the store (say Safeway?). If I can‚Äôt find it, will allspice be an okay substitute? Thanks for sharing!

Hey Sam, yes, it is just ‚Äúwhole allspice‚Äù if you prefer. Just not ground. Enjoy!

Two questions: 
Do you drain the sauerkraut first? 
Is 3/4 cup water really enough to boil the potatoes?

Hey Cathy, yes, the sauerkraut should be drained. Also, the potatoes are diced, so yes, 3/4 cup of water should be enough, and they can steam too. Enjoy!

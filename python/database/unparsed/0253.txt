Pumpkin marmalade recipe ][5]
Oranges, lemons, fresh ginger root and, of course, plenty of pumpkin make for an original spread for your morning toast. You could also try it with scones and cream, or use as a flan filling. Pumpkin is particularly good for making jams and marmalades because it absorbs sugar beautifully.
Makes a 1.75kg jar of marmalade.

Step-by-step
1. Peel the pumpkin and remove all the seeds and fibres. Slice the flesh into pieces and grate coarsely lengthways, so the strands are as long as possible. 
2. Put the grated pumpkin in the preserving pan with the water, oranges, lemons, and ginger. Bring to the boil, then simmer for 25-30 minutes or until the citrus peel is just soft. 
3. Add the sugar, stirring until it has dissolved. Return to the boil, then cook over a medium heat for 25-30 minutes or until the mixture is thick enough for a wooden spoon drawn through the centre to leave a clear channel. 
4. Remove the pan from the heat and leave the fruit to settle for a few minutes. Ladle the marmalade into the hot sterilized jars, then seal.

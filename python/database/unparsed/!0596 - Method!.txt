Instructions 
Note: Check out the recipe video for visual instruction!
Polenta:
Bring coconut milk and vegetable broth to a boil in a pot. Stir in polenta by using a whisk.
Reduce heat to a low simmer and continue to whisk for 1-2 minutes to avoid lumps.
Then cover and let simmer for about 10 minutes (or according packaging instructions), stirring occasionally. (If the polenta thickens too much you can add additional milk and/or water and stir to thin.)
Once the Polenta is creamy and smooth, remove from the stovetop. Add nutritional yeast or vegan parmesan and stir (optional).
Mushroom Spinach Topping:
Heat oil in a skillet or pan. Add mushrooms along with onions and fry for about 3 minutes on high heat or until beginning to get golden-brown.
Add minced garlic and roast for 30 seconds longer. Then add soy sauce and spinach and cook for 1-2 minutes or until spinach is wilted. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Add a splash of fresh lime juice, if you like.
Toast pine nuts in a small pan without oil until lightly browned.
Serve polenta with mushrooms, spinach and pine nuts.
Enjoy!
Notes
To make it even simpler and creamier, I prefer using finely ground polenta, that takes only 2 minutes to cook. If using regular yellow corn grits please read the cooking time stated on the package. Otherwise you could also use cornmeal.
Instead of coconut milk you can add any plant-based milk. Add 1 tbsp vegan butter, if using low-fat milk.

Nice recipe and really good combination of ingredients. 
Two questions about website/post: 8-9 photos of the completed dish and none of the process along the way? Was looking to see what size to chop the onion, for example, but not a single photo of the prep process? Maybe I missed something? 
Comments section allllllllll the way at the endddddd of the loooooong string of comments. Almost couldn‚Äôt find it? 
Thank you! Elizabeth

Loved this easy to make vegan dinner. Added a red leaf lettuce tossed salad and dinner was ready in no time. 
I have a soy allergy so used Naked Coconut soy free soy sauce substitute. It worked out well. Loved the nutritional yeast added to polenta and on top of salad for added Protein. 
Will definitely make again üëç

I am really not a mushroom fan so this recipe was a risk for me, but oh man did it pay off! I can‚Äôt believe I‚Äôd never thought to make polenta with coconut milk before, but the end result was absolutely delicious, especially next to the soy sauce-y vegetables. Plus the whole recipe comes together super quickly and easily. This one is definitely entering my rotation!

Polenta in my country is called sadza or pap. We make it so that it‚Äôs solid enough to hold as a ball in your hands. I like experimenting with it as well. Maybe one day you might try the version you can eat with your hands.

OMG, you are amazing! I was so excited to stumble upon your blog that I spent three hours reading and copying your recipes to my tablet and then, of course, subscribed. I‚Äôve been a vegetarian for over 30 years and am always looking for new foods to try and inspiring ways to prepare them. I‚Äôm retired and spend a significant amount of time reading vegetarian and vegan blogs, and I have never been so Inspired!!! I know I‚Äôll be having lots of fun and inventive yummy meals for months. I counted how many recipes I copied so far that I feel I must try, and I came up with 48! I started with this polenta dish because I had all the ingredients in house, also because it‚Äôs been a favorite food since childhood. My family of Italian ladies, who could make you swoon over the simplest preparations, used to make what they called mush. They would cover a dinner plate with the soft polenta, top it with a long-simmered marinara and freshly grated aged cheeses imported from Italy. When one of the ladies made mush, word spread and we would all descend on her kitchen to slurp and laugh, very fond memories. I didn‚Äôt mean to write a novel, sorry. One brief mention. I only had coarse ground polenta, Bob‚Äôs Red Mill, and it was still creamy and smooth. I recently followed their instructions for making it in the slow cooker with vegetable broth, literally add to cooker, set and forget, no stirring, and it was perfect. Well, time to peruse which Bianca creation to make for tonight‚Äôs dinner. Thank you for these treasures and for the artistry with which they‚Äôre presented.

I‚Äôve only ever seen polenta in the cold vegan/vegetarian section at my grocery store. It comes in a tube of about 16 oz. i believe it is usually sliced and fried to make polenta cakes. Is this the same polenta you used in your recipe?

Hi Marissa,

I made this recipe yesterday and we liked it. Might try a different type of milk (I don‚Äôt care so much for coconut). 
But the creaminess of the polenta was great ? Next time I might also add some different spices to the polenta and more veggies. Definitely try it out.

Amazing recipe! I added grounded nutmeg & chilli flakes to the polenta and used sunflower seeds and pumpkin seeds along the pine nuts. So yummy! Thanks for sharing

I made this for thanksgiving and my family really liked it! I forgot my nutritional yeast so I was a bit bummed about that but it still came out great. I also doubled the recipie and had to add some corn meal in the end to thicken it a bit.

Hi Bianca, 
Can we keep creamy polenta in the fridge ? If yes how can we heat it again ? 
Thank you

Hi Lola, 
You can heat up Polenta in the microwave but I recommend to serve Polenta immediately because it gets firm after cooling.

Oh my god this dish is so tasty! Made the polenta last night and it was so creamy. Really liked the seasoning on the mushrooms too. Didn‚Äôt have any lime juice so added some capers and chilli flakes which worked well, and used cauliflower and kale as I was out of spinach ‚Äì such an adaptable recipe that I‚Äôll definitely be using it again!

Made this on a chilly Canadian fall night after work. (1) Was SO fast to make (2) Was SO warm and comforting (3) HELLO SO DELICIOUS. So easy with so much flavor I could cry. Had it for lunch the next day and the flavors had developed even more. 
THANKS BIANCA LOVE YOU!

Thanks for this recipe! Made a double batch for company and everyone loved it. I was a little short to double the mushrooms and spinach so I roasted some brussels sprouts for some extra veg and it worked out perfect. I never would have thought to make polenta with coconut milk AND broth, totally amazing and creamy!

Hi Bianca! My 29 year old is Vegetarian, mostly vegan plant based and tagged me for this recipe. My mouth was watering! We made it for my 52nd birthday. My choice for dinner. It was super delicious. The polenta was a nice change. We thought to throw in some sun dried tomatoes and serve over a pasta or rice next time. Will make again for sure!

Sourdough English Muffins (whole-wheat)
April 21, 2020Bread, Breakfast, Savory Breads and RollsHaley Hansen1 Comment
_The first thing to make with your sourdough starter that isn‚Äôt bread is a batch of Sourdough English Muffins! They‚Äôre easier than you may think, and even tastier than you could imagine when they're homemade with simple, healthy ingredients - no unfamiliar preservatives or additives needed. After one bite of these english muffins, you may never go back to the store-bought version._
WAIT! Have you read my Sourdough Guide: How to Make Your Own Starter yet? If not, check that out to make sure you‚Äôre ready for some sourdough baking. 
Before I made a loaf of sourdough bread with my homemade starter, I made a few other things: pizza crust, cinnamon rolls, biscuits, and English muffins. Taking on the challenge of successfully making a loaf of sourdough bread would require more confidence in my fermentation, folding, and waiting skills than I had four weeks ago, so these recipes were my pep-talks, my confidence-boosters, my you-can-do-this recipes. Much to my surprise, each was successful! Bubbles surfaced at every stage of the process, and the finished products met all the respective requirements - chewy, tangy, airy, crusty and unmistakably sourdough. 
Sourdough English Muffins \(whole-wheat\)][2]
As listed above, those first four recipes are in order of deliciousness (according to my scale), and the order surprises me still, considering that pizza and cinnamon rolls are two of my truest food loves. They just‚Ä¶ they just need some improvements and those aren‚Äôt at the top of my to-do list. (My bread to-do list. Actually, that‚Äôs the only real to-do list I have right now.) The biscuits were so tender and flaky you almost feel sorry eating such a delicate little thing, and woven through the layers of butter and flour was a sourdough flavor balanced so perfectly you‚Äôd wonder how a home-baker like myself could pull off such a recipe. 
The English muffins. They get their own paragraph, so clearly, they‚Äôve won my favoritism. I won‚Äôt deny that some of the packaged, store-bought English muffins I‚Äôve known all my life are tasty and worth your time and money. If caring for a homemade starter and dedicating the less-than 1 hour of active hands-on cooking to making fresh sourdough English muffins is not in your interest, you‚Äôll be just fine eating the store-bought versions. If, however, you are half as obsessed as I am with sourdough starters (and naming them!) and fresh-baked bread, then you are in the right place and this is the right recipe for you.

If you‚Äôre even more like me (let‚Äôs be friends!) you might even like this more than your homemade sourdough loaf. Many home-cooks and avid eaters (of which I am both) alike associate this task with intimidation and great pressure, which is ironic because a good loaf of bread is made without an ounce of actual pressure. And this high pressure raises our hopes and expectations that the final product - the golden-crusted loaf baked just right with air-pockets of sourdough-tang - will be everything we ever dreamed it would be. In fact, with all the mixing and waiting and folding and waiting and rising and waiting required, that loaf better be everything I dream of! 
Alas, it just wasn‚Äôt. Kids, not everything turns out exactly how you want it to. That‚Äôs life sometimes and bread is no exception. 
Sourdough English Muffins \(whole-wheat\)][5]
Though it was time-consuming and high-maintenance, it was simple. Though it was simple, it was‚Ä¶ a bit too simple. Overpowered by all-purpose flour, air holes as big as yawns, and a crust chewy enough to play tug-of-war-with, the sourdough flavor I craved just wasn‚Äôt there. Sliced and served alongside a pot of sausage and vegetable soup, it did its job - the crust soaked up the broth and added chew, and the tangy, air-pocketed interior multiplied the comfort factor of the meal by ten. 
Beautiful, simple, laborious - the sourdough loaf was almost everything I thought it would be. As I tore off bites of that first loaf, I made mental notes of potential improvements. Next time, I‚Äôll play around with hydration levels, flour blends, and proof times to alter the flavor and texture in hopes of achieving a loaf with a little something more. 
Sourdough English Muffins \(whole-wheat\)][6]
And when I finished my soup, salad, bread, and dinner conversation with my quarantine buddies, I grabbed a bowl, a spatula, my starter, and some flour to mix English muffin dough, looking forward to the next day‚Äôs breakfast.

_Notes:_
_You can adjust the ratio of all-purpose or bread flour to whole-wheat flour if you‚Äôd like, but just know that more whole-wheat flour will make for a denser, chewier muffin. You can also use 100% all-purpose or bread flour and leave the whole-wheat out completely to yield a tender, tall, fluffy muffin. I‚Äôve done this a few times and it‚Äôs delicious!_
_Using buttermilk enhances the tangy flavor, multiplying it with the flavor from the sourdough starter. For a less pronounced tang, switch to low-fat milk._
RECIPE 
Makes about 8 English muffins 
350 grams flour (100 grams whole-wheat flour + 250 grams all-purpose or bread flour) 
130 grams active and bubbly sourdough starter 
125 grams buttermilk (low-fat or 2% milk will also work) 
10 grams salt 
Oil, for cooking 
1. In a large bowl, stir together the flours and salt. Add the sourdough starter and buttermilk and mix with a rubber spatula until the dough comes together. You can also use your hands to gently bring the dough together, gathering any pieces that have stuck to the sides of the bowl. It should be sticky!
2. Shape the dough into a round and cover the bowl tightly with plastic wrap. Set the bowl out at room temperature - 70-75F is best - for 4-5 hours. This is the first fermentation. 
3. Lightly flour a clean work surface and your hands. Remove the dough round from the bowl and place it on the floured surface (save the plastic wrap to use it again!). Use a bench scraper or large chef‚Äôs knife to divide the dough in half, and then each half into four equal portions. 
4. Gently roll each portion in between your hands into a round and place on a clean plate. Cover the plate with the plastic wrap and refrigerate for 14-16 hours, or overnight. This is the slow fermentation. 
5. When you‚Äôre ready to cook them, remove the plate from the fridge and let them sit out at room temperature for about 10 minutes before cooking. 
6. Meanwhile, heat a nonstick skillet over low-medium heat and lightly grease with oil, about 1-2 teaspoons (you don‚Äôt need much). Transfer the dough portions to the skillet, leaving about 2 inches of space between each to ensure the skillet isn‚Äôt over-crowded. Cook on one side for 5 minutes, then flip and cook for another 5 minutes. By this time, they‚Äôll have risen and each side should be golden brown and the centers will likely still be pale and just undercooked. Cook each side on low heat for an additional 2-3 minutes, or until the center is no longer pale. It should be the same color as the outside edges of the English muffins. Transfer to a plate to cool completely before serving. 
7. For best nook-and-cranny results, poke a fork horizontally through the center of the English muffin all the way around and gently pull it apart. Toast it and spread a little butter, jam, and/or peanut butter. My favorite combination is peanut butter, banana, a little honey and a sprinkle of cinnamon and sea salt. So tasty! 
8. Store leftovers in an airtight container at room temperature for up to one week, or in the freezer for several months.

best üëèüèº homemade üëèüèº sweet potato üëèüèº wedges üëèüèº even the bf loves them - he came back for seconds! I also think the colors are just gorgeous before baking, but swipe to see the drool-worthy after photo üíØ
bull;&bull;
RECIPE \(basically just a how-to because it&rsquo;s so simple\):
1. preheat the oven to 450F &amp; line a baking sheet with parchment or a silicone baking mat.
2. chop the sweet potato into wedges about 1/2-inch thick all around. toss in 1-2 tbsp. oil, or enough to lightly coat all surfaces of the wedges. toss in salt, pepper, &amp; garlic powder. 
3. bake for 20 minutes, then flip the wedges.
4. bake for 10-12 more minutes, or until browned on at least 1 side &amp; tender. they will continue to cook once out of the oven, so it&rsquo;s okay to take them out when they don&rsquo;t feel fully tender yet. 
5. cool slightly before serving. definitely recommend serving these with a garlic aioli, which is posted with this recipe on the blog! ü§ó][12]

bull;&bull;
i think it&rsquo;s important to lean on loved ones &amp; seek professional help when we need it. I also think it&rsquo;s important to remember that we know ourselves better than anyone else, &amp; that we are stronger than we may think! 
bull;&bull;
on the blog today, I&rsquo;ve rounded up the habits I&rsquo;ve implemented to help me stay connected to myself &amp; strong from within:
an energizing morning routine 
journaling 
intentional time alone 
positive self-talk
linked in my bio!
bull;&bull;
thank you @vitalproteins for encouraging us to be our best selves! ‚ú®][15]
I&rsquo;ve been hearing lots of &ldquo;how many calories did you burn?&rdquo; talk at the gym lately. did you know that the machines are not accurate, even when the user inputs their metrics? in fact, even your fitness tracker isn&rsquo;t going to be 100% accurate at measuring calorie burn. 
bull;&bull;
most importantly, when we focus only on the calorie burn during a workout, we miss out on all of the more sustainable &amp; fulfilling reasons to exercise, like:
improved digestion &amp; metabolism 
better quality sleep
enhanced mood &amp; cognition 
FUN! 
bull;&bull;
just like food is more than a nutrition label, your workout is more than a calorie burn! üí™üèº‚ò∫Ô∏è][16]
ldquo;the way you awaken makes a world of difference&rdquo; ‚ú® YES it certainly does! I&rsquo;m such a morning person already, but I also firmly believe in making the most out of my morning to start my day off on the right foot. gratitude journal + coffee + movement are my priorities ü§ç
bull;&bull;
honourtheday nailed it with these new cups! how pretty are they?! MN peeps, if you haven&rsquo;t yet made it to Honour in NE Mpls, let me strongly encourage you to do so! the Miel latte is my favorite, but you really can&rsquo;t go wrong with anything on menu or in the pastry case ü§©][17]
rounded up some of the words I&rsquo;m loving lately ‚ò∫Ô∏è‚òùüèº daily reminders, words of encouragement, little bites of inspiration - use them however you like! ‚ú®

squeezed in a little &ldquo;me time&rdquo; at the gym this morning ‚ò∫Ô∏è it got me thinking - we don&rsquo;t always &ldquo;have&rdquo; time, but we can almost always make the time. sacrifices might be involved, but your physical &amp; mental health is important!

every form of exercise provides some form of benefit\(s\) to the body &amp; mind. we could argue all day about which is &ldquo;better&rdquo; - going back &amp; forth between this benefit &amp; that benefit. but what matters MOST is what exercise YOU enjoy ‚ò∫Ô∏è
bull;&bull;
I like lifting, and I also really enjoy spin workouts. I almost never do yoga, and I frequently walk on the treadmill or outside. that&rsquo;s what works for me. it&rsquo;s not right or wrong by anyone&rsquo;s definition but my own. &amp; the same goes for you - what&rsquo;s right for you is what benefits YOUR body &amp; YOUR mind. so embrace that! ü§ç][26]

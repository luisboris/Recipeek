Instructions
Heat the oil or lard on medium heat and brown the meat on all sides for a few minutes.
Add onions, mix well and cook for 5 minutes over medium-high heat, stirring constantly.
Add tomatoes, hot pepper (optional), allspice, paprika and caraway. Mix well.
Cover with hot broth and mix well. Season with salt and pepper. Simmer for 2 hours over low heat, stirring gently.
30 minutes before the end of cooking, add marjoram and flour diluted in a small amount of boiling water. Adjust the seasoning if necessary.
Check the tenderness of the meat. Cooking may have to be extended if necessary. If this is the case, adjust the amount of broth accordingly. The sauce should be plentiful and unctuous.
Serve hot with fresh bread, as well as sliced scallions.

I made it with lamb and couldn’t get enough of it! Next, I am going to try it with chicken thighs. I did a few things differently than the recipe but I think the end result must have been pretty close to the what was intended. I cut the lamb into pretty small pieces, I used a ~15 oz can of crushed tomatoes, olive oil, I did not preheat the broth and I added the marjoram with all of the other spices. i simmered it for over 2 hours and it was incredible. The next morning I took it out of the refrigerator and removed the fat that had solidified on top. It seemed just as rich after I reheated it. I wish I could give it 10 stars!

Ingredients & Substitutions
Cassia cinnamon – Also known as Chinese cinnamon.
Clove – May use Mandarin orange peel instead.
Fennel seed – This is a very flavorful spice that tastes like licorice. Feel free to use ginger root instead for a well-rounded, albeit different flavor.
Star anise – Similar to fennel, this spice has a licorice-like, sweet yet peppery flavor. You may use anise seeds instead.
Szechuan (Sichuan) pepper – You may use plain black pepper instead, although it won't be the same. Szechuan pepper produces a tingly, numbing effect in the mouth when eaten, so it's hard to find a close substitute.

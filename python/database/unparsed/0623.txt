What is himbasha?
_Himbasha, hembasha_ , or _h’mbasha_ (ሕምባሻ) in Ethiopia, or _ambasha_ in Eritrea (አምባሻ), is a traditional flat bread for Christmas ( _Leddet_ ) and special occasions, with a sweet and salty flavor.
There are several variations, however it is always distinguished by the presence of ground cardamom seeds.
It is, in fact, common to add candied ginger or raisins to the recipe, but the cardamom version is the more traditional and the most frequent version.
How to prepare himbasha
Unlike injera, the other popular bread in the region, which requires at least 48 hours’ rest, himbasha is made the same day.

This is a classic bread dough, requiring two risings. It contains the five classic ingredients of flour, sugar, water, yeast and salt.
The preparation is an extremely simple process. The ingredients are mixed, with a gradual addition of water to the flour to obtain an elastic and homogeneous dough.
In addition to cardamom and other seeds, some fat is incorporated into the dough during kneading. This can be either neutral vegetable oil, olive oil, or niter kibbeh (Ethiopian spicy clarified butter).
After rising the second time, and just before being brushed and then put in the oven, the himbasha is decorated by scoring with a knife. Decoration varies but in general, it is usually the shape of a wheel with grooves arranged in such a way as to create rays.
Himbasha can be cooked either in the oven or in a pan.
How to eat
Given its barely sweet and spicy profile, the accompaniments to enjoy himbasha can be both sweet and savory.
It can be soaked in niter kibbeh, also known as _tesmi_ or _tegelese tesmi_ , a clarified butter, similar to ghee. It’s spicy and seasoned, and widely used in Ethiopian and Eritrean cuisines.
It can be drizzled with honey, or a mixture of niter kibbeh and honey.
It can be dipped in awaze, a traditional Ethiopian sauce or spice paste, made with _berbere, mitmita_ and _t’edj_ (mead), that’s eaten with most of the main dishes of the country, or used to prepare them.
It is also eaten with hummus, _yetsom beyaynetu_ (an assortment of vegetables), or _kitfo_.
It can also be enjoyed hot or warm, plain.

Customs relating to himbasha
Himbasha is certainly the bread par excellence of the Christmas season in Ethiopia and Eritrea, but it is also prepared for very special occasions.
For example, it is customary on a child’s first birthday to place bread on their back and break it in half. Traditionally, this would bring future prosperity to the child.
It also symbolizes good health, safety and a multitude of blessings.
Himbasha is also a bread commonly made for Sunday breakfast, to be eaten immediately after mass.
On Christmas Day, it is the children who bring and / or serve himbasha to their parents, who in return give them blessings and a gift.
Regardless of the celebration, himbasha is a loaf of bread that symbolizes a good luck charm for prosperity, good health and security.
Christianity and Christmas in Ethiopia
In Ethiopia, Christmas is not celebrated on December 24 and 25, which are normal working days, but on January 7, like many Orthodox churches around the world.
The Ethiopian Orthodox Church considers January 7 to be the day of the birth of Jesus Christ.
Christmas in Ethiopia is called Leddet and also _Genna_ or _Kollé_ depending on the ethnic groups and local populations. Since the months of the Ethiopian calendar are different, _Ganna_ is the 29th day of the month of _Tahsas_.
Christianity in Ethiopia is the largest religion in the country, and dates back to the ancient kingdom of Aksum, (4th century BC to 10th century AD) in the Horn of Africa, during the reign of Emperor Ezana. Ezana reigned from c. 325 to 356, and was the first Ethiopian monarch to embrace Christianity. This makes Ethiopia one of the first regions in the world to officially adopt Christianity.
Located at the crossroads of trade routes between India and the Mediterranean, the Kingdom of Axum was an important state in the Horn of Africa located north of Ethiopia, Djibouti and present-day Eritrea.
About a month and a half before Christmas in Ethiopia, believers fast, and eat only one meal a day. Fasting in this context means no meat, eggs, fish, cakes, alcohol or dairy products. In other words, it is a vegan fast. The fast is broken on Christmas Eve, before celebrating this event with a hearty meal composed of himbasha.
As in all countries that celebrate Christmas, in Ethiopia special importance is given to the food on these festive days.
The 43-day fast is also interrupted at dawn on January 7 with a light meal, but later in the day, in addition to himbasha and its accompaniments, Ethiopians eat doro wat and injera with which to pick up the stew.

Ingredients
6 cups flour
1½ tablespoons active dry yeast
2 teaspoons ground cardamom
1 tablespoon fine salt
⅓ cup caster sugar
½ cup niter kibbeh (melted and cooled) or olive oil
2 tablespoons tikur azmud or habba sawda (Ethiopian nigella) or black sesame seeds
2 cups lukewarm water (more or less), at 95 F / 36°C
For brushing
3 tablespoons milk
3 tablespoons niter kibbeh (melted and cooled), or olive oil
Equipment
Stand mixer
Pastry brush
Sharp knife
Rolling pin
2 round pans (about 12 inches / 30 cm in diameter)
US Customary \- Metric
Instructions
In the bowl of a stand mixer, add the flour, ground cardamom, sugar, tikur azmud or habba sawda (Ethiopian nigella) or black sesame seeds and mix.
Dig a well in the center of this mixture, add the flour in the center of this well and add 1 cup (250 ml) of lukewarm water.
Leave to rest for 15 minutes.
Add the melted niter kibbeh and start kneading at low to medium speed while incorporating the rest of the lukewarm water very gradually until you obtain a soft and homogeneous dough that comes off the sides of the bowl.
Add salt and knead at medium speed for 5 minutes.
On a lightly floured work surface, roll out the dough and place it, covered with a cloth, in a warm place, away from drafts, for 90 minutes so it can rise.
At the end of the first rise, knock back the dough on a lightly floured work surface and divide it into two dough pieces.
Roll out the two dough pieces into a circle about 12 inches (30 cm) in diameter.
Place each circle in a round baking pan, such as a pizza pan.
Cover the two himbasha, and place them in a warm, draft-free place for 10 minutes, for a second rise.
Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 350 F (175°C).
Using a sharp knife, or cookie cutters of different sizes, mark 4 to 5 concentric circles on the first loaf, working from the center to the edges, then make cuts intersecting in the center to form a wheel pattern.
On the second loaf, make decorative patterns.
Froth the milk and melted kibbeh niter (or olive oil) in a bowl.
Brush the himbasha with this mixture and bake for 25 to 35 minutes until cooked through and golden brown.

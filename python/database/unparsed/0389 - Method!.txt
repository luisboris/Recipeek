Instructions
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (180 degrees C) and line the bottom of an 8-inch springform pan with parchment paper.
In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment, beat egg whites with 1/2 cup sugar on high speed until stiff peaks form, about 8 minutes. Transfer to a large bowl and set aside.
In the bowl of the stand mixer (no need to clean the bowl) fitted with the paddle attachment, combine egg yolks, remaining 1/2 cup sugar, and vanilla extract. Beat at medium speed until thick and creamy. The mixture will change color from yellow to a paler color. Add egg yolk mixture to the egg white mixture and carefully fold it in with a spatula, DON'T stir the mixture.
Combine all-purpose flour, baking powder, cornstarch, and cocoa powder. Sieve over the egg mixture and fold in carefully until combined.
Transfer to the springform pan and smooth top with a silicone spatula. Bake for 25 minutes or until a skewer interested in the center comes out clean with only a few crumbs attached.
Remove the ring of the springform pan and carefully turn cake onto a parchment paper-lined cooling rack, peel of parchment paper from the bottom and let cool completely.
When the cake is cooled completely use a serrated bread knife to cut the cake into three even layers.
To make the cherry filling, remove 4 Tbsp of cherry juice from 1 cup of cherry juice and combine it in a small bowl with the cornstarch and sugar. Bring the remaining cherry juice in a small saucepan to a simmer, remove from the heat and whisk in the cornstarch mixture. Bring back to a simmer while whisking constantly until it starts to thicken. Whisk in the cherries and remove from heat. Add about half of the kirsch to the cherries or leave it out. Let cool for 5-10 minutes.
To make the whipped cream, beat 4 cups of heavy cream (depending on your mixer you might have to whip the cream in two batchein the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment at high speed until soft peaks form. Then add 1/2 cup powdered sugar and beat until stiff peaks form, about 2-3 minutes longer. The whipped cream should be very stiff and spreadable but be careful not to over-whip it. Refrigerate whipped cream until ready to assemble.
To assemble the cake, put the cake layer that was the top before on a platter. Put the springform ring (or use a cake ring around it to make it easier to assemble the cake. Drizzle some kirsch or cherry juice over the cake, then top with half of the cherry mixture leaving a 1-inch border. Top with about 1/4 of the whipped cream, smoothing it out with a spatula.
Top with the middle cake layer and repeat drizzling with liquid, topping with cherries and cream. Put third cake layer on top (smooth side up). Set aside about ¬æ cup of cream for decoration. Spread 1/3 of the remaining whipped cream on top, then remove springform ring and spread remaining cream with a spatula around the sides of the cake until completely covered in whipped cream.
Decorate sides of the cake with grated chocolate. Pipe 16 swirls of whipped cream on top and garnish middle of the cake with remaining coarse chocolate. Put a cherry on each cream swirl and refrigerate cake until serving.
Notes
Note 1: I use jarred sour cherries for this recipe, Walmart has them in the International Aisle with the German Ingredients. They come already pitted and in light syrup. The light syrup works great as cherry juice. If you can‚Äôt find jarred cherries, you can use canned cherries or defrosted frozen cherries. If the cherries don‚Äôt come in light syrup, use cherry juice instead.
Note 2: If you can‚Äôt use kirsch just leave it out of the cherry filling and drizzle the cake layers with some cherry juice.
Note 3: I always use Dutch-process Cocoa Powder because that is the one that is common in Germany

This looks really delicious! I was wondering if the recipe could be converted to bake in a 6 inch pan instead as it‚Äôs just for 2 people. What percentage would you recommend that I reduce the recipe by and typically how long I should adjust the baking time to?
Can‚Äôt wait to try it out!

I haven‚Äôt tried and tested it but you should be able to bake it in a 6-inch pan. Making half the recipe might work but I‚Äôm not sure about baking time and exact measurements.

Hello,
I‚Äôm wondering if you use cherries or sour cherries in the recipe as both are mentioned, but they taste completely different? 
Thank you!

Hello,
It looks really yummy! & the guidelines that you wrote down in order to make cake is awesome. 
I was planning to follow another recipe of black forest cake but when saw your page,really want to make on my daughter‚Äôs graduation party on July 30th.. I want to make this cake in 13√ó9 pan on her graduation as she really loves black forest cake. 
Please can you help me out 
1- Do i need to increase the ingredients & how much ? 
2- I bought the maraschino cherries üçí can i use those & how much& can i use the syrup of this cherries instead of krich ? 
3- I saw in some recipes they use i tbsp coffee in the cake mix, would you prefer?
Thanks

I have never made the cake in a 9√ó13 pan but I would double the recipe. I don‚Äôt recommend using maraschino cherries (or the syrup of maraschino cherries), they are a lot sweeter than normal cherries and would change the whole cake. You can use them as a garnish. If you don‚Äôt want to use kirsch you can just leave it out. You could add instant coffee to the cake mix if you like, it intensifies the chocolate flavor. Hope this helps and congratulations to your daughter!

Sorry, this happened to your cake Mahima, there are a few reasons why this might happen. Check out the part of the post titled ‚ÄúReasons why your sponge cake might have turned out flat, collapsed after baking or is dense and compact‚Äù. That should help you figure out what went wrong!

is there any way to make this like the trend ‚Äúletter cakes‚Äù that are on social media lately? I am trying to combine the two concepts but wanted the cake to be authentic taste ‚Äì figured will have to bypass the shape and that they dollops of icing wont work since will be real whipped cream ‚Äì thoughts‚Ä¶

Mmh I have never tried it with this cake, but you could bake it in a 9√ó13 pan, only cut it once, so you have 2 layers, and then cut out the letters. Depending on how many letters you need you will need to make more than one cake. The whipped cream could work but it needs to be very well whipped or stabilized.

Ingredients
200 grams (7 oz) long grain brown rice
250 millilitres (8¾ fluid oz) water
½ teaspoon salt (Himalaya or sea salt)
750 millilitres (25¾ fluid oz) milk (any you prefer although full fat is used tradionally. I use soy milk)
250 millilitres (8¾ fluid oz) milk (any you prefer)
2 handful raisins (optional)
1 teaspoon rapadura sugar (or other raw cane sugar)
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
Preparation
1. Wash the 200 grams rice and place in a large saucepan along with the 250 millilitres water and ½ teaspoon salt.
2. Turn the heat up and allow the rice to simmer for 20 minutes. Keep the lid on.
3. Pour the 750 millilitres milk into the saucepan. Allow to simmer for 40 minutes with the lid on at the lowest setting.
4. Add 2 handful raisins if you prefer and cook for a couple of minutes.
5. Some, like me like more hot milk as opposed to serving the pudding very thick with cold milk. Add 250 millilitres milk if you like warm milk and allow to simmer for 5 minutes.
6. Mix together 1 teaspoon rapadura sugar and 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon. Serve in a separate bowl.
Tips
You can make excellent rice patties out of this pudding.
You can prepare this a day ahead, just keep it chilled in the fridge and make sure you serve it piping hot.
You can use long, white rice if you prefer or pearl barley.
You can use any milk you prefer although full fat milk is normally used. I use soy milk.

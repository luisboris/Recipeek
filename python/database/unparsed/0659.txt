_Sma≈æen√Ω s√Ωr_ (fried cheese in Czech) is a recent post war, nontraditional addition to Czech cuisine. It consists in slices of cheese that are breaded before being pan-fried or deep-fried.
Sma≈æen√Ω s√Ωr is typically prepared with Edam, Gouda or Muenster, but it can also be prepared with Hermel√≠n (Czech camembert) or Niva (Czech blue cheese). It is traditionally served with a Czech version of tartar sauce ( _tatarsk√° om√°ƒçka_ ), and French fries or boiled potatoes.
This delicious vegetarian delicacy is also called _sma≈æ√°k_ in Czech, _vypr√°≈æan√Ω syr_ in Slovak, and _r√°ntott sajt_ in Hungarian. When it includes ham or bacon, it is called sma≈æen√Ω s√Ωr se ≈°unkou or plnƒõn√Ω sma≈æen√Ω s√Ωr.
In the Czech Republic, sma≈æen√Ω s√Ωr is not an appetizer, but rather a full vegetarian meal. The breaded cheese slices can be eaten with a fork and knife, and dipped in tartar sauce, or they can be placed in a bun to make a sandwich.

Sma≈æen√Ω s√Ωr absolutely needs to be consumed hot as when it cools, the cheese hardens. It tastes best when the hot cheese melts and oozes out of the crusty shell while cutting it.
Czech fried cheese][12]![Czech fried cheese][26]
Cheese is thought to have originated in the Middle East. The process of cheese making is depicted in murals in Egyptian tombs that date from 2,000 BC.
Fried cheese was probably popular in both Ancient Greece and Ancient Egypt. Athenaeus, the 3rd century Greek food writer, relates that the Greek poet Pherecrates spoke a lot about ‚Äúmelted cheese sizzling‚Äù. The Greek delicacy is known as saganaki, and this is the one I flamb√©ed (American style) in my own kitchen‚Ä¶ with a fire extinguisher not too far‚Ä¶
In Medieval times, fried cheese was also a common food in Egypt where it was called _gebna maqleyya_ (ÿ¨ÿ®ŸÜÿ© ŸÖŸÇŸÑŸäÿ©). To this day, this Egyptian snack is cooked in oil and served with bread by street vendors.
Fried cheese is also common in a number of other countries, including Cyprus, Lebanon, Syria and Turkey, where it is served as a breakfast dish.
_Queso frito_ (fried cheese) is served as a tapas dish in Spain as well as in Central America. In Spain, fried cheese balls are called _delicias de queso_. _Malakoff_ are balls of fried cheese that are traditional in Western Switzerland. _Kaassouffl√©_ is a Dutch snack consisting of melted cheese inside a thin dough-based wrap (often puff pastry) which has been breaded before being deep-fried.
And let‚Äôs not forget the Italian version called _mozzarella fritta_ , and is now quite popular in the United States, especially in the form of mozzarella sticks, that are often served with marinara sauce or ranch sauce. _Mozzarella in carrozza_ (mozzarella in a carriage) is a specialty from Southern Italy which consists in a fried cheese sandwich, similar to a French _croque-monsieur_ or American grilled cheese sandwich.
I had the opportunity to taste sma≈æen√Ω s√Ωr in Prague a couple years ago, as we visited the beautiful capital with the whole family. There, we met with one of my best friends‚Äô parents, originally from Prague, and we feasted at a traditional Bohemian restaurant, after a visit at the top of the Old Town Hall.

Sma≈æen√Ω s√Ωr
Sma≈æen√Ω s√Ωr (fried cheese in Czech) is prepared with slices of cheese that are breaded before being fried. It is traditionally served with tartar sauce and French fries.
Prep Time10 mins
Cook Time15 mins
Total Time25 mins
Course: Appetizer, Main Course
Cuisine: Czech, Vegetarian
Servings: 4 people
Author: Mike Benayoun
Ingredients
4 ¬Ω-inch/1cm thick slices cheese (Edam, Gouda or Hermel√≠n)
1 cup all-purpose flour
2 eggs , beaten
1 cup bread crumbs
2 cups vegetable oil
For the tartar sauce (tatarsk√° om√°ƒçka)
4 tablespoons mayonnaise
1 tablespoon vinegar
1 teaspoon mustard
4 gherkins (pickles) , finely chopped
1 tablespoon capers
¬Ω onion , grated
Salt
Freshly ground black pepper
US Customary \- Metric
Instructions
Place the flour in a shallow bowl, the eggs in another and the breadcrumbs in a third.
Dredge a slice of cheese in the flour.
Then dip it in the beaten eggs, submerging it to wet it all over.
Finally cover with bread crumbs, making sure the cheese slice is completely coated.
Repeat the same operation with the egg and bread crumbs. The double coating ensures the cheese does not leak when frying.
Set aside on a plate and repeat with the other slices of cheese.
Chill in the fridge for at least 30 minutes.
Czech tartar sauce (tatarsk√° om√°ƒçka)
Meanwhile, prepare the tartare sauce by mixing together the mayonnaise, vinegar, mustard, gherkins, capers and onion in a small bowl. Season to taste with salt and pepper and set aside.
Heat the oil in a deep fryer or in a pan at medium/high heat until it reaches 350F/180C.
Deep fry the cheese slices for about 20 seconds.
Serve immediately with boiled potatoes or French fries, as well as tartar sauce.
Notes
Deep frying will be a quicker frying method and will avoid any leak of cheese. You can also pan fry the cheese slices on each side in hot oil until golden brown.

Ingredients in Oven Roasted Eggplant][4] ![Roasting eggplants for Pasta all Norma - Eggplant Pasta][5]
I cut the eggplant cubes a little bit smaller than when I roast eggplant cubes to serve as a simple side dish or to use in salads (like this Eggplant Lentil Salad ‚Äì it‚Äôs very, very good!). I find a slightly smaller size is more suitable for pasta ‚Äì for dispersion and how it eats.

And here are the other ingredients in Pasta alla Norma. _Basil_ is a key ingredient that really adds a fresh touch to the finished dish but if you don‚Äôt have it, don‚Äôt worry, I have solutions for you. Read on!

Ingredients in Pasta all Norma - Eggplant Pasta sauce][6]
Pasta ‚Äì any kind will work here except really tiny ones like risoni or those tiny alphabet or other novelty pastas. Traditionally, macaroni is used but these days it‚Äôs made with all sorts of pastas ‚Äì short (like rigatoni, penne, ziti, casarecce) and long (spaghetti, fettuccine, bucatini). I really like serving it with long pasta ‚Äì especially with the smooth pasta sauce I use in this recipe;
Tomato passata ‚Äì aka tomato puree: This is strained, plain, pureed tomato which is thick and smooth, so it‚Äôs brilliant for quick pasta sauces. Normal crushed or diced canned tomato will also work but you will need to simmer for around 20 minutes until the tomato starts to break down to create a nice thick pasta sauce. You‚Äôll find passata in the pasta section of regular supermarkets nowadays, and it doesn‚Äôt cost much more than canned tomato. _More on Tomato Passatahere;_
White wine ‚Äì optional ingredient, just a splash to add extra flavour to the sauce. Good trick for when you are making quick sauces! Any white wine that‚Äôs not too sweet or woody will do here. I use sauvignon blanc and pinot gris because that‚Äôs what I drink;
Garlic and onion (or Eschallots) ‚Äì essential for flavour base for simple pasta sauces, without which the sauce is too bland!
Italian herb mix or oregano ‚Äì to add a touch of extra flavour into this quick sauce;
Chilli flakes ‚Äì aka red pepper flakes, for a touch of warmth. 100% optional; and
Basil ‚Äì as my brother sternly told me, ‚Äúit‚Äôs not Pasta alla Norma without basil!‚Äù. Having said that though, I have made it many times using fresh thyme, which goes so well with eggplant. Also you can increase the amount of dried herbs in the pasta sauce instead and it is still 100% delicious. it‚Äôs just not true, traditional Pasta alla Norma that‚Äôs all!
Here it is with thyme instead of basil. And it‚Äôs still absolutely delicious!

How to make Pasta alla Norma pasta sauce
This is a nice quick recipe because we‚Äôre using Tomato Passata. It‚Äôs already smooth compared with crushed tomato, which needs at least 20 minutes to break down to thicken the sauce.
Making tomato pasta sauce for Pasta all Norma - Eggplant Pasta][8]
We start by saut√©ing the onion and garlic, add the white wine and let it simmer rapidly to cook out the harsh winey smell, leaving behind its tasty flavour base which adds an extra _something-something_ to our pasta sauce!
Then just add the Tomato Passata, dried herbs, salt and pepper and simmer for just 5 minutes. Finally, fold through the roasted eggplant, toss through pasta, throw in some basil and you‚Äôre done!
Traditionally in Sicily, Pasta alla Norma is served topped with grated _ricotta_ _sal_ _ata_ , a firm, salted version of ricotta. However ricotta salata is difficult to source outside of real Italian delis, so I use grated parmesan cheese or pecorino instead.

What to serve with Pasta alla Norma
The other great benefit of this eggplant pasta dish is that it‚Äôs loaded with a good amount of vegetables from both the tomato and eggplant, so you really don‚Äôt even need to add a side salad to supplement your daily vegetable intake! It really is a complete meal.
However, if you did want to add a side salad, a classic Italian Rocket Salad with Shaved Parmesan would be ideal. The balsamic dressing in that salad really complements the flavour in this pasta. Otherwise, put together your own salad with a Balsamic Vinegar Dressing.
For a big Italian night in, add a side of proper Italian focaccia or garlic bread. Or if you want to go _all_ the way, upgrade to _Cheesy_ Garlic Bread and finish with a classic Tiramisu. And don‚Äôt forget to invite me over for dinner! üòâ _‚Äì Nagi x_

Recipe video above. This is a traditional Italian pasta dish from Sicily, usually begun by cooking eggplant on the stove in a hefty amount of oil. I prefer roasting the eggplant ‚Äì less oil plus the eggplant holds its shape better, especially when you roast at a high temp to caramelise the surface!
Finishing with a good amount of fresh basil is traditional but even if you don't have any, there's other alternatives to add a touch of other flavour ‚Äì such as fresh thyme, or extra dried herbs in the sauce.
This is an excellent and satisfyingly "meaty" vegetarian main dish that will have even card-carrying carnivores asking for seconds!

Ingredients to Make Briami
To make Briam or Briami vegetable bake, you will need:
All or some of the following vegetables: Zucchini, eggplant, potato, tomato, onion (red or yellow).
Passata, canned diced tomatoes , or use fresh tomatoes and blitz them in a blender or food processor until smooth.
Garlic, oregano, salt, and pepper.
Olive oil, and fresh herbs (I used thyme, but you can also use rosemary).

How to Make Briam?
Start by slicing the vegetables. You can either use a mandoline slicer or a sharp knife to slice into round shapes. I try to pick vegetables that are similar in thickness to make a pretty Briam and for the veggies to cook evenly.
Slice the onion into half-moons as they’re easier to eat once roasted compared to whole rounds.
To a large mixing bowl, add the sliced veggies and drizzle with olive oil, add garlic, oregano, salt, and pepper. Give everything a good mix so that the veggies are well seasoned.

To an oven-proof dish (I use this baking dish – it’s my fav!) add the diced tomatoes or passata and 1/2 cup of water. Then arrange the seasoned vegetables in rows (see picture below). You can randomly lay out the veg slices if you don’t want to spend too much time arranging them.
If there’s any olive oil left in the mixing bowl, pour that over the vegetables, I would also recommend taking a brush and brushing some sauce over the veggies. Tent foil to cover the baking dish, and place in a preheated oven.

Bake at 390°F (200°C) for 30 minutes, check if the potatoes are tender, and remove the foil. Roast for 10-20 more minutes for the liquid to reduce and the vegetables get that golden brown color.

You may want to place the dish under the broiler for 5 minutes to get the veggies to crisp up a bit.
Serve with feta cheese, crusty bread, and olives.

Top Tips
To jazz things up a little, add bell peppers and fresh parsley.
Don’t skip covering the baking dish with a tent foil, as covering it will allow the hot steam to cook the vegetables well especially the potatoes.
When roasting, as I check on it I spoon some sauce over the vegetables for them to cook better.
Add your favorite fresh or dried herbs to the vegetables.

Making Ahead and Freezing
I like to make this dish ahead of time, then either store in the fridge covered tightly with foil or freeze it.
To reheat from frozen, thaw completely then place in the oven and add a splash of water. Bake until it’s fully reheated and bubbling. 
I sometimes pre-portion leftovers and store them in the fridge in airtight containers.

What to Serve With
You can enjoy Briam as a main dish or a side dish. If you’re roasting a whole chicken, fish, or some kind of meat, then Briam makes a great side dish. Serve it with rice on the side.
I personally like to serve Briam with a piece of crusty bread and crumbled feta (use vegan feta if following a vegan diet). You can also enjoy it with yogurt, and olives.

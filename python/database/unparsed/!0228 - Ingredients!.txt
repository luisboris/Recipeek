SA PANADA

Sa Panada][1]
Today I want to share with you the recipe of a very ancient dish: _Sa Panada_. And when I say “ancient” I mean it, as it appears that it was already known more than 2000 years ago! The name _panada_ literally means “ball” and it is a traditional pie from the region of Sardegna (Sardinia), which is this week’s choice for my Regional Italian dishes series. It was traditionally made with eels, while now you also find _panadas_ with other types of filling. Today I will share with you the recipe for a _panada_ filled with lamb and potatoes, which is another typical filling as Sardegna is famous for lamb and sheep products (especially sheep milk cheeses). It is delicious and I think it also makes a great picnic meal! Enjoy!
Ingredients (for 4 panadas of 10 cm – 4 inches):
_For the pastry 
_350 gms – 12.3 oz. all purpose flour 
350 gms – 12.3 oz. durum wheat flour 
70 gms – 2.5 oz. lard 
1 ¼ tsp salt 
Water, lukewarm
2]
_For the filling 
_500 gms – 1.1 lbs lamb, cut into big cubes 
500 gms – 1.1 lbs. potatoes, thinly sliced 
8 sun-dried tomatoes, minced 
1 clove of garlic, minced 
50 ml – 1.7 oz. extra virgin olive oil 
½ tbsp parsley, minced 
Salt and pepper
Put the flours, salt and lard in a mixer. Add 3 tbsp of lukewarm water and mix it. Keep adding the water 1 tbsp at a time, until your mixture comes together. Knead it on a lightly floured surface for a couple of minutes, then make it into a ball. Cover it with cling wrap and let it rest for 30 minutes.
3]
Now, roll the dough into a 5 mm (0.2 inches) thick sheet and cut 4 rounds big enough to fit your pie pans (remember you have to have enough dough to completely cover the sides and leave about 5 mm (0.2 inches) above the border to be able to close the pie). Keep the remaining dough aside (cover it with cling wrap to prevent it from drying out).
Now you can fill the pies. To do this you have 2 options. You can either fill it in layers (sun-dried tomatoes & garlic & parsley, potatoes, lamb, oil and so on). Or mix all the ingredients together in a bowl and then fill the pies (1-2-3-4).
Roll the rest of the dough and cut 4 rounds to close the pies. To do so, place the rounds on the top of the pies and pinch well all around the borders (5-6). Make sure the pies are closed well as the meat cooks with the steam and if there are holes, the pie will become dry.
4]
Bake them in a pre heated oven at 200°C – 390°F for about 2 hours. To check if the _panada_ is ready, gently shake it: if the content moves, then it is cooked.

Those are adorable 🙂 And I’m so glad you went with the lamb and potatoes as opposed to the eel. They’re always my favorite when I find them on a dive so I couldn’t possible eat them!
BUZZED!

Wow! Great post! However, I am an experienced cook, and I’ve never seen a recipe that directs a pie to cook at 390° F for “almost” TWO hours… maybe I’ve not looked at enough recipes, but….
Still, I’m inspired to bookmark this with the intention of making it sometime since I am very fond of savory pies.

They look fabulous. i will make this at Easter. May I use Butter or shortening for the lard?

Hi Evelyn! I think butter or shortening would work too… the crust was flaky and crunchy at the same time. I have not tried it myself, but I don’t think it would be an issue. 🙂 Let me know how you go!

Hi Manu! I want to try making these beauties – what cut of lamb did you use? I’m not sure some of my family would be up to the lamb however – have you ever tried making this recipe with a cut of beef? Thanks so much, this post was very helpful!

21]Manu says
June 28, 2013 at 10:04 pm
Hello! I have used the leg (I bought it already cut) for this dish. I have never made it with beef, but as it has to cook for a long time, I would probably try with chuck steak… it should remain soft! 🙂 Let me know!

Hi again! I tried making Sa Panada last night and the beef worked really well! I used cubed sirloin, thinly sliced potatoes, a wee punch of garlic and some diced roasted tomatoes. I kind of screwed up the pastry I think – it was REALLY crunchy – but they were darned cute little pies! Definitely going to try my hand at the pastry again!

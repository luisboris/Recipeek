What are humitas?
Traditionally from Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, Ecuador and Peru, _humitas_ is a dish of pre-Columbian origin prepared with corn, tomatoes and cheese.
Where does the word humitas come from?
The noun “humita” is derived from the word “huminta”, which comes from the Quechua word _humint’a_. In Corrientes, an Argentinian province, it is known as “mbutacá”, a Guarani expression.
In Paraguay it carries the Guarani name of “ka’i ku’a” whose translation into Spanish is “monkey waist”. It received this name because the way of tying the humitas resembles a form similar to the waist of the monkeys. It is a very traditional dish in some Paraguayan towns as it was widely consumed by the Guarani Indians.

In Venezuela humitas en chala are called “cachapa de hoja”, which means “leaf cachapa”. In this case they are prepared with sweetcorn, or _bollito_ (bun), if made with white corn.

Regional variations
Traditionally from the Andean region, humitas is a very popular dish among different Latin American countries and their cuisines.
In Argentina there are two types of humita, _en chala_ and _en olla_ (in pot).
The preparation method for both is exactly the same (the same corn cream is made with the same ingredients) but the difference lies in the fact that, in the case of “en chala”, once the mixture is ready, small portions are taken and wrapped in the corn husks, and shaped into small packages to be boiled in salted water for several minutes.
Argentinian humitas don’t include meat.
To make the corn cream ( _crema de choclo_ ) it is necessary to grate or mechanically process the corn kernels. Although both methods are accepted, the difference is that in the first method the cream is prepared without any of the corn skin, so it’s softer. If mechanically processed, it is a little more doughy, with more texture.
In addition, some people also add pumpkin to the preparation.
In the Pampas region of Argentina, the filling of empanadas made with corn or corn cream is also called humita. The full name of this dish is _empanadas de humita_.
In Bolivia it is mostly consumed in the regions of Tarija, La Paz, Cochabamba and Chuquisaca. In this country, humintas are baked, steamed or grilled, and don’t have all the ingredients of Argentinian humitas, but only corn, butter, cheese and aniseed.
On the other hand, in the Chilean region, humitas are prepared in a very similar way to the Argentinian ones, except that sometimes they also contain basil and green chili.
In Ecuador, humitas are a very traditional dish, and are also called _choclotanda_. They are prepared in a similar way to those listed above, except that instead of butter they use pork fat, and the seasoning may vary. Such is the consumption of this dish, that there are specific pots to prepare it.
As in most countries, humitas can be made both sweet and savory.
Finally, in Peru the cream that forms the humita is prepared with corn, cheese, raisins, sometimes meat and a variety of spices.
In this country, one of the oldest references to this food appears in the work, “Comentarios Reales” (Royal Commentaries) by Inca Garcilaso de la Vega. It dates from 1539, and tells of his memories, in which he recalls having eaten humitas during his stay in Peru.

Remove the corn from the cob using a grater or a sharp knife.
Heat the oil and butter in a skillet over medium heat.
Fry the onion for 1 minute, then add red pepper and garlic, and sauté until the onion is translucent.
Add the tomatoes, paprika, oregano, cinnamon, salt and white pepper, and mix well.
Fry for 15 minutes, stirring regularly.
Remove from the heat, and add the corn, milk, cheese and sugar, and mix well.
Place 2 corn leaves crosswise onto a work surface.
Place 2 tablespoons of corn stuffing in the center.
Wrap the contents as if they were bundles, and tie them with the corn strips cut for this purpose.
Heat a large amount of salted water in a pot and add the 2 bay leaves.
Place the humitas into the water, and boil for 30 minutes.
Serve hot.

Because they originated with indigenous people, and date back so far, there’s virtually no documented evidence of their history, Franc. Which is a shame, I agree. However, I can tell you that they were originally called “jumint’a”, and we cooked in earth ovens!

A not-so-common dish made of corn. Very interesting. I’ll try this one.

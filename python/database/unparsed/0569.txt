Do you know what Barbara Kingsolver calls the ‚Äúfirst fruit of the season‚Äù?
Rhubarb!
Along with asparagus, it's one of spring's earliest crops to push through the earth and burst into bountiful harvest. And thankfully, it sticks around for another month or two. I, for one, celebrate its longevity.
Every year my kitchen and freezer overflow with goodies. Classic rhubarb crisp, rhubarb cookies, rhubarb bread, rhubarb jam, rhubarb marshmallows‚Ä¶ I've got an entire Pinterest board dedicated to rhubarb!
And yet, my favorite way to eat it isn't in a dessert. When confronted with an army of volunteer rhubarb plants in my garden one year, I discovered _rhubarb salsa_.
It. Is. Scrumptious. Tart, spicy, sweet, and addictive.
I now stash tortilla chips in the house so my husband and I can dig in at a moment's notice. üòâ
Now, unless you have a greenhouse and plant your peppers √ºber early, there's no way to make this recipe entirely from seasonal, fresh ingredients. I chop and freeze the peppers when they're ready in late summer and then toss them in the food processor as the recipe calls for ‚ÄìOR‚Äì freeze the rhubarb and make this recipe in late summer when peppers and onions are in season. Since we're going for a slushy, chunky texture, frozen peppers work fine.
Oh, and don't skimp on the ginger or the honey in this recipe, as they make the flavor of the rhubarb really shine.
Happy eating!

Rhubarb Salsa
Over the past few years I have come to love rhubarb salsa. It. is. scrumptious. Tart, spicy, sweet, and addictive. Make sure you don't skimp on the ginger or the honey in this recipe -- they make the rhubarb flavor shine! Recipe courtesy of Restocking the Pantry. _Makes approximately 2 1/2 cups._
Course Dips & Spreads 
Author Kresha Faber
Ingredients
1 tablespoon orange zest from approximately 1 orange
7 to 8 stalks rhubarb coarsely chopped (a generous 2 cups)
2 to 3 inches fresh ginger peeled and finely grated
1/2 small yellow onion finely diced
1/2 small red onion finely diced
1 to 2 jalape√±o peppers seeded and minced
1/2 green bell pepper diced
1/2 cup raw honey
3 tablespoon lemon juice from approximately 1 lemon
1 teaspoon sea salt
1/2 cup fresh whey OR sauerkraut brine (optional)
Instructions
1. Soften the rhubarb for 10 to 15 minutes by simmering it in a few tablespoons of water over medium heat.
2. Remove the rhubarb when it begins to fall apart, and place it in a blender, food processor, or large bowl.
3. Add all remaining ingredients and blend together until a chunky puree is formed. (If you‚Äôre working by hand, just toss everything together well.)
4. Adjust seasonings.
5. To ferment, if desired, stir the whey or sauerkraut brine into the salsa, then spoon into a quart-sized Mason jar.
6. Let sit at room temperature for 1 to 2 days, then store in the refrigerator for 3 to 4 weeks.
7. While this salsa can be eaten immediately, it does taste significantly better if let sit for a few days, so let it sit if you have the time.
Do you love rhubarb? Have you ever made rhubarb salsa?

Thanks, Catherine! Looks great!
Out of curiosity, whenever I‚Äôve used raw rhubarb in salsa, it has overpowered the other flavors in its tartness. Do you find this one has a good balance? I haven‚Äôt used that much cilantro before, so maybe that‚Äôs the secret. üòâ

The salsa looks amazing‚Äìand I love that it‚Äôs fermented!
I love making our rhubarb iced tea. It‚Äôs rhubarb juice we‚Äôve made steeped with a black tea, a little lemon and maple syrup. Serve cold over ice with crushed basil‚Ä¶oh my goodness. So refreshing and always a surprisingly big hit with guests.
Then I take the rhubarb pulp and make a moist loaf of dessert bread with it.
The next plan is to add some whey to our rhubarb juice and try out rhubarb soda!

Delicious. I didn‚Äôt have any red onion or orange zest, so I substituted all yellow onion and lime zest. Turned out great and can‚Äôt wait to make it again!

Did you try canning, Gerry? I was debating preserving this recipe this weekend and am wondering how it could turn out!

Have you ever tried to can this salsa? Or just refrigerated it?

I‚Äôve only ever eaten it fresh (i.e. made the batch, refrigerated it, and then enjoyed it within a few days). üôÇ
I assume this recipe could be canned, but you would need to use a pH meter or other similar tool before beginning to know exactly what you‚Äôre dealing with. Rhubarb is definitely acidic enough, especially with the lemon juice, but there are fair bit of peppers and onions, which are rather alkaline, so this recipe would be rather iffy unless you‚Äôve got a gauge to help you keep the blended salsa in a safe acidic range for canning.
Those are my initial thoughts, but I‚Äôd love to hear from someone more experienced with canning rhubarb!

When you let it sit in counter for a day or so do you cap the mason jar while fermenting?

Can you use stevia or another low carb sweetener in this recipe? I cannot have sugar, honey, maple syrup, etc. I am also thinking about canning the salsa. TIA

Do you think that I could use ginger bug instead of whey?

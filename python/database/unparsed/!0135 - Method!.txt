Instructions
Cut a slit lengthwise in each eggplant and roast on stove, grill or in the oven.
Set the eggplants aside to cool down for 10 minutes.
Scoop the pulp out and place in a colander lined with cheese cloth or a clean kitchen towel to drain excess liquids.
Place the pulp on a cutting board and chop with a sharp knife then put in a deep bowl.
In a jar or a small bowl combine garlic, olive oil, lime juice, vinegar, salt and pepper.
Pour the vinaigrette over the eggplant and mix well.
Taste to adjust seasoning.
Mix in the green onions. Refrigerate for 1-2 hours before serving.
When ready to serve, garnish with olives and whatever you choose and drizzle some olive oil on top.
Notes
Roasting eggplant over open flame is always my preferred method as it makes the dip more smoky. You can also use your outdoor grill or in a 450F oven. It will take probably between 20 to 30 minutes.
If you roast in the oven adding a little liquid smoke or smoky paprika would help get you some smoky flavor.
Make sure to drain the eggplant for this recipe or else you might end up with a watery dip.
You can place all the ingredients in your food processor for a smoother dip.
Garnishing options: aside from chopped parsley and walnuts you might want to try some chopped tomatoes, roasted peppers or feta cheese for a salty Mediterranean flavor.
Customize the dip to your liking. Although not traditional but you can spice it up with some smoked paprika, cumin, cayenne or chili powder.
If your eggplant is a little bitter mix in about 1/4 teaspoon of sugar to help with that.
This dip is better served cold, serve it with pita , crusty bread or veggie sticks. Also great with grilled meats.

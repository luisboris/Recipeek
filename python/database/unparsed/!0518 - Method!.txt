Instructions
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F.
Mix together the lemon juice, olive oil, and melted butter in a shallow bowl (do not add the garlic yet). Set aside.
In another shallow bowl, mix the all-purpose flour, spices, salt and pepper. Set next to the lemon sauce. 
Pat the fish dry. Dip the fish in the lemon sauce then dip it in the flour mixture. Shake off excess flour. Reserve the lemon sauce for later.
Heat 2 tablespoon olive oil in a cast iron skillet (or an oven-safe pan) over medium-high heat (watch the oil to be sure it is shimmering but not smoking). Add the fish and sear on each side to give it some color, but do not fully cook (about 2 minutes on each side). Remove the skillet from heat.
To the remaining lemon sauce, add the minced garlic and mix. Drizzle all over the fish fillets.
Bake in the heated oven until the fish flakes easily with a fork (10 minutes should do it, but begin checking earlier). Remove from the heat and sprinkle chopped parsley. Serve immediately.

Notes
Serving suggestions: Serve immediately with Lebanese rice and this Mediterranean chickpea salad or traditional Greek salad.
Cook's Tip: This recipe has been edited adding step 5 to achieve more color. Be sure to use a fish spatula to carefully turn the fish in the skillet.
Leftover Storage: If you have any leftovers, let the fish cool a bit, then arrange in a shallow glass container with a tight lid. You can refrigerate for 2 to 3 days, or freeze for up to one month. My personal preference is not to freeze fish as, sometimes, the texture does change.

Hello! I've never tried this with lime myself, but another reader has, and it sounds like it turned out great!

Delicious! I’m strict clean Keto so I did make a few changes to make it keto. Instead of flour I used fine ground pork rinds. I only made half the cod called for but I made the whole sauce and spice recipe. I served the cod over cauliflower rice seasoning with a bit of olive oil and some of the spices and topped with the parsley and some pine nuts. I served the cod rice dish with a side salad and used the ratio of lemon juice and olive oil as the dressing for my salad. Hard to imagine a more tasty flavorful healthy meal. If you are keto never shy away from non keto recipes that are healthy. With just a few minor changes you can still enjoy. The seasoning in this dish where spot on. Thanks to the author for sharing it is definitely a keeper!

This was fantastic! I'm very picky about fish and very intimidated to make fish at home, but this recipe was perfect. I did have to cook my cod for about 12 minutes instead of the 10 in the recipe but my filets were fairly thick. This paired nicely with the Greek lemon rice on this site, too. This is going on our repeat list!

Very good and very easy to make. The flavors are basic and not unusual which is the only reason I gave it 4 stars. It is a great seafood recipe to have on hand. To keep it from getting “gloppy” when breading it make sure there in minimal lemon sauce and flour mixture on the fish. It is quick and easy to make after guests arrive because it finishes in the oven.

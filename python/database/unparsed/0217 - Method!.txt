1 
Bring the water to the boil and add plenty of salt. Whisk in the polenta and simmer for 45 minutes, stirring often to break up any lumps. If the polenta becomes too thick and starts sticking, add a little more water 
2 
Remove the rind from the cheese (if it has one) and dice into small cubes 
3 
Stir the milk into the polenta to loosen, then add the cheese and butter and continue stirring until melted. Taste for seasoning and serve with plenty of black pepper (and a little more melted butter) on top

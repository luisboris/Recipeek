Instructions
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (180 degrees C). Wash 4-5 medium-sized tilapia fillets with water and pat them dry using a paper towel. Line the tilapia fillets on a 9×13 inch baking tray.
Note – if using frozen fillets, thaw them before using.
Stir together 1 tablespoon lemon juice, 3 tablespoon melted unsalted butter, 1 teaspoon minced garlic, ½ teaspoon hot paprika (or Kashmiri red chili powder), ½ teaspoon salt, and ½ teaspoon freshly cracked black pepper in a small mixing bowl.
Pour the marinade over the Tilapia fillets. Arrange 3-4 slices of lemon over the fish.
Bake uncovered for 15-20 minutes or until the fish is flaky and fork-tender. Garnish with pepper flakes, lemon slices, and chopped parsley or cilantro, and serve hot.
Notes
Make sure to dry the fillets after washing them. You can dab them with a kitchen towel to take out the extra water.
Do not overcook the fillets. they will turn a little chewy if overcooked.
You can try swapping the butter with coconut oil, olive oil, etc.
You can increase the amount of lemon juice if you like the baked tilapia tangier.
Use lime juice instead of lemon juice if you like it tangier.
Use the residual liquid to pour over the fish fillet once you have served it on the plate.
Serve this lemon garlic baked tilapia as an appetizer or with steamed rice and sautéed vegetables as the main course.

This looks delicious! I would like to make this ahead of time for quick lunches. After this is baked, does it freeze well? 
Thank you!

Can you substitute olive oil for butter? If not, do you have an alternate to butter for use in this recipe? I am excited to try but can’t use butter. Thanks

This was wonderful! It’s the first time I’ve ever baked fish and not had my house overwhelmed by fish smell! While it was baking, it just smelled of fragrant garlic (I doubled it) and mine cooked through right at 10 minutes. 
I had a half a pint of grape tomatoes that were starting to go & needed to use them up. I sliced them in halves and sprinkled them all around the pan before baking. They cooked perfectly and added such a wonderful flavor! I also mixed cilantro with my parsley because I had some chopped. Mmmmmm!
I served mine with some curried couscous. It cooks in 5 minutes and is very light like the Tilapia.
Thank you for so much for the recipe and thank you everyone else for adding their own suggestions. I always read through the comment section first out of curiosity 🙂

Love it! The i didn’t have butter so I subbed extra virgin olive oil. The sauce was delicious. I had a little sample before pouring it over the tilapia and it could be used as a tangy salad dressing with a kick! Simple and delicious. Thank you!

Perfect except for the sliced lemons… The sliced lemons give too strong of a flavor. The little bit of lemon juice in the recipe is good enough. I love the spice from the chili powder to combat the tangy lemon. And who doesnt love garlic ????. I baked on 450 for 8 mins.

Ingredients in Indian Eggplant Curry][3]
Don’t fret if you can’t get all the spices – I have solutions for you! See the recipe card notes.
The two ingredients in this eggplant curry that makes it stand out as a truly authentic South Indian Curry are black mustard seeds and curry leaves.
Eggplant – small to medium eggplants are best so every piece has a bit of skin which helps them hold together when simmering in the sauce, rather than turning into a big pot of eggplant puree. Asian eggplants (the thin ones) will also work here;
Black mustard seeds – they look like poppyseeds but have a slight wasabi-like bite to them. And they smell Indian, not Japanese! 😂 Not spicy, more a fresh zing. _It’s about $1.50 in small packs at Indian grocery stores – I go to Indian Emporium in Dee Why on the Northern Beaches, Sydney. Also sold in the Indian food section at someWoolworths (Australia) $1.70, and also sold online – small, light pack so postage should be minimal! __Also used in_ Dal _and in thisVegetable Samosa Pie which is to-die for! _
Curry leaves – it smells like curry powder, but in fresh curry leaf form! (Though just so you know, curry powder isn’t derived from curry leaves 🙂 ) Curry leaves add incredible curry perfume into anything it’s used in. Fairly accessible nowadays for Sydney-siders, sold at Harris Farms, most Coles and Woolworths. _I intend to find a plant!_ They keep for ages in the fridge – as in several weeks – or can be frozen. _This too is used in_ __Dal _and theVegetable Samosa Pie. Throw in 10 or so when cooking _Curried Rice _, or into this_ Indian Chickpea Curry _or_ Vegetable Curry _– it will really take it to a new level!_ Substitute: dried curry leaves (not quite the same, but it’s the best sub) or Garam Masala powder;
The other spices – nothing out of the ordinary here, everything you find at local grocery stores;
Coconut – coconut milk or cream is fine here. Only 3 tablespoons – it doesn’t make it taste of coconut, but it’s remarkable what a difference it makes to add a touch of luxury to the mouthfeel of this curry. _Leftover coconut milk:_ _Freeze the rest in ice cube trays and use in recipes that call for a splash of coconut. Otherwise, do a recipe search for “coconut milk” and select “Using this ingredient” and it will bring up a list of recipes that have coconut milk in the ingredients. Most recipes won’t suffer if you are short just 3 tbsp. Partial can uses: Gado Gado peanut sauce, scaled down batch of Thai Satay Peanut sauce._
Tomato – anything is fine here, pulp or passata (base recipe), or canned crushed tomato (crush it more by hand to make it more fine) or even a dollop of tomato paste;
Garlic and ginger – as with most Indian curries, a good wack is essential for a good curry experience!
How to make it – Roasted Eggplant for curry
Here’s how to roast the eggplant – cut into thick batons (they shrink a lot), then roasted at a high temperature with just 2 tablespoons of oil so the outside is nicely caramelised, the inside is soft and juicy, and it holds its form rather than collapsing into mush. Simply the best way to cook eggplant in the oven!

Notice how the eggplant pieces are beautifully browned on the outside and still holding their form, rather than being a soggy pile of mush (which is what happens if you roast at a lower temp). _Just_ holding in the juicy insides!!
How to make Eggplant Curry
And here’s how the curry is made:
How to make Indian Eggplant Curry][6]
Fry off the mustard seeds and curry leaves – _your house is going to smell insane!_
Cook off the ginger and garlic (your house will smell even more incredible!);
Add the spices (your neighbours will catch a waft and start salivating);
Then tomato and water, mix it up into a very intensely flavoured curry sauce;
Add eggplant and simmer so it absorbs the flavour (neighbours will come knocking at this point);
Then lastly, stir in the coconut milk (neighbours will be camped out on your door step, refusing to leave without a taste).
What it tastes like
This is not one for the faint hearted – it’s not mild and creamy like Butter Chicken. It’s a very intense authentic Indian curry flavour, as opposed to a generic flavour like those recipes you see made with a load of just “curry powder” and maybe some Garam Masala.
The dominant flavour here are the curry spices – you can’t taste the tomato (for thickening the sauce) nor the coconut milk (for slight richness to mouthfeel).
Also, another specific characteristic with this curry is that it’s not saucy. It’s one big pot of juicy (I’m going to say it!) MUSH. You don’t need a separate sauce!

Healthy! 250 calories per serve.
Indian food actually uses a LOT of oil in cooking. You would fall off your chair if you knew how much your friendly local Indian restaurant is using for his curries!
Yes there’s still 5 tablespoons of oil in this, but it’s a vegetable curry so lacks all the additional fat that the meat in a meat curry would drop and so has to compensate to be tasty.
But it’s not so unhealthy – in fact, it clocks in at just 250 calories per serving!
Though if I had my way it would be 1/2 cup of oil ….😂 _– Nagi x_
PS. Pictured here with basmati rice and dollop of yogurt. Naan or this simpler flatbread for stuffing wouldn’t go astray as alternatives. For a fresh side, try this South Indian-style Cabbage & Carrot Salad with Coconut, this Minted Yogurt Tomato Salad, this fresh creamy Cucumber Salad or even plain roasted Broccolini (skip the Tahini sauce in the recipe). More Veg and Salad Sides here. And if you’re going low carb, use Cauliflower Rice instead (the sauce is so strong, you won’t care).

Recipe video above. This curry is not for the faint hearted! Eggplant (Brinjal) stars in this strong flavoured curry, roasted rather than fried for a healthier yet equally delicious (high temp does the trick here), then simmered in an intensely spiced South Indian curry sauce so it sucks up the flavour and partially collapses to create a big pot of juicy (delicious) mush. 
Incidentally vegan (as much of South Indian food is). See recipe notes for subs for the harder to find spices. And when you've made this, use the same spices to make this Vegetable Samosa Pie!
Spiciness: Pretty mild. Spiciness only comes from the chilli powder so if you're concerned, skip or reduce it!

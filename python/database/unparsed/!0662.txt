methi ka thepla][3]![methi ka thepla][4]
besides, some important tips and suggestion for a perfect methi thepla recipe. firstly, soak the fenugreek leaves in warm water for minimum of 15 minutes. this ensures to reduce the bitterness taste of fenugreek leaves. thepla has to be fried on medium to high flame and not on low flame. on low flame the thepla would turn hard and brittle. adding curd is optional while kneading the dough. however curd helps to make thepla soft, but skip it if you are vegan. lastly, do not forget to add ajwain or carrom seeds which help in digestion of gram flour.

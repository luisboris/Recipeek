Instructions
Combine yogurt with half of the mint, half of the garlic, 1/4 teaspoon salt and black pepper. Transfer to a small serving bowl. Swirl in 1 teaspoon olive oil on top and garnish with more mint.
Heat the grill or grill pan over medium-high heat. When ready oil the grates.
Toss the vegetables in a bowl with olive oil, lemon juice, remaining garlic, zaatar, 1/2 teaspoon salt and black pepper, to taste. Grill the vegetables turning occasionally, until lightly charred, about 6 to 10 minutes. Arrange on a platter with the mint yogurt sauce. Sprinkle with remaining mint.

Wow!!! This recipe is amazing. I don‚Äôt usually like zucchini or squash and with this I was going back for more!!!! I sliced them thin and charred them so the texture was crispy. So delish!!!!! And the yogurt sauce was the perfect compliment.

This was delicious and so easy!!!

Can this be made in an oven or on the stovetop. Don‚Äôt have a grill
Gina ‚Äî September 23, 2019 @ 8:37 am Reply
Sure a grill pan on the stove works.

Are your WW SP values based on the original SPs or the new Freestyle SPs? I prefer the old version. Thank you.

I made this for a Fourth of July party and it was a huge hit! Vegetables can be served room temperature and the sauce is so refreshing!

Hi Gina, 
Do you think fresh basil would be a good alternative to the mint?
Gina ‚Äî June 30, 2019 @ 4:26 pm Reply
Sure!

Such a good recipe Gina! This will be a regular in my rotation. I can eat these veggies every day. Loved it!

I made this last night and it is the PERFECT summer side dish. The yogurt mint sauce is amazing. Super refreshing on a warm evening ‚Äì I ended up putting it on everything. And the Za‚Äôatar seasonings on the grilled vegetables was addictive. My husband asked me to keep this in our ‚Äúweekly rotation‚Äù so I know it was delicious! Thanks Gina!

Hi Gina! This looks amazing!! I‚Äôm just not a mint fan (other than cookies ‚Äì ha!). What would you recommend as a sub? Thanks for all you do to keep us on track, full and happy! üôÇ

I made this recipe right away since I had everything at home for it, and the mint sauce was even fantastic on top of my burger. I totally loved it! I halved the sauce recipe since there‚Äôs only two of us, but kept the same amount of garlic ‚Äì pros: really delicious, cons: my breath could kill a vampire. Thanks for the great recipe! üôÇ

Where do you get or what is in the Zataar seasoning???.
Cynthia ‚Äî August 3, 2020 @ 8:10 pm Reply
I bought it at a local middle eastern store. 
13. Janessa ‚Äî June 26, 2019 @ 3:06 pm Reply
What is Zataar seasoning? I‚Äôm in Canada but Ive never heard of it. Where can it be purchased? 
Gina ‚Äî June 26, 2019 @ 5:24 pm Reply
It‚Äôs a dry mix, I found this recipe to make 5 tbsp: 2 tablespoons minced fresh thyme, 2 tablespoons sesame seeds, 2 teaspoons ground sumac, 1/2 teaspoon coarse salt
14. Juju ‚Äî June 26, 2019 @ 9:38 am Reply
I love grilled vegetables, and this looks like a great recipe. But I haven‚Äôt found a grilling basket/pan that I like. They‚Äôre too hard to get clean. I‚Äôm considering trying a grill mat. But what do you use for vegetables on the grill? Thanks for any suggestions you can offer.
Lisa ‚Äî June 28, 2019 @ 8:26 am Reply
I use a super cheap grate from the dollar store. I‚Äôm in Canada, but I think they have them in the US at grocery stores and such. They are super thin, ok for 4 or 5 uses (I just brush mine with the grill brush). 
Very similar to this..

You usually link to the product you like to use‚Ä¶.
do you have a favorite Zaatar brand that you like for your mint yogurt sauce?
Gina ‚Äî June 26, 2019 @ 5:26 pm Reply
Sure this is the brand I use https://www.amazon.com/Zaatar-Penzeys-Spices-cup-jar/dp/B06XCNXMH6/ref=sr_1_24?keywords=zatar&qid=1561587950&s=grocery&sr=1-24&th=1

Debbie, 
Check out the Penzey‚Äôs website. Their spices are amazing! I have a store near my house and am on sensory overload when I got in the door, it smells so good! 
If you get on the mailing list, there‚Äôs often free giveaways with orders, etc.

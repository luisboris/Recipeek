Any Iranian will say that a meal is not complete without _torshi_!
This is probably one of the longest recipes ever shared. Long and yet so simple. Torshi can be stored for several years and actually becomes tastier with age.
What is torshi?
Torshi are vegetables that are pickled in brine from the cuisines of several countries in the Balkans and the Middle East, as well as Arab countries.
They are called torshi (ترشى) in Egypt as well as in Iran, _tirşîn_ or _tirsi_ in Kurdistan, _tursu_ in Turkey, _τουρσί_ or _toursi_ in Greece, _turshiya_ (туршия) in Bulgaria, _turšija_ (туршија) in Bosnia and Croatia, _turshi_ in Serbia, _tourchi_ or _tourchou_ in Armenia, and _khamusim_ (חמוםים) in Israel .

Torshi are also very popular in other parts of the world and in different cultures, especially with the Afghans, Albanians, Pakistanis, and Macedonians.
What is the origin of the word torshi?
The word torshi comes from the word torsu which itself comes from the word torsh, which means “sour” in Farsi and in Kurdish. In Turkey and in Azerbaijan, it means the same thing but the word is pronounced tursu.
The different versions of torshi
At the beginning of the fall, Iranians prepare a wide variety of torshi according to regional customs and holidays.
Although you could make torshi with many different vegetables, there are 3 torshi recipes that stand out and are the most popular:
_torshi litéh_ (ترشی لیته): eggplant, carrots and herbs 
_torshi badem-joon_ (ترشی بادمجون): eggplant 
_torshi seer_ (سیر ترشی): garlic
How to make torshi seer
The recipe presented here is torshi seer, which literally means “garlic preserved in vinegar”.
Torshi seer, in its simplest version, is made with garlic, salt and vinegar. The vinegar can be as simple as white vinegar as well as cider vinegar, sweet wine vinegar, malt vinegar, or balsamic vinegar.
If white vinegar is used, honey will generally be added to the torshi recipe. A mixture of spices or herbs may also be added including cloves, or barberries.

Fermenting the garlic torshi for a long time will help make the garlic melt in the mouth. The garlic should be pickled with its skin, the thinnest that is in contact with the pulp. The garlic and its skin will soften with age. After a few years, it can be spread on a piece of meat, fish or bread. In Iran, they even make sandwiches with it.
After a few weeks, the garlic can sometimes develop a bluish or greenish hue. The change of color is not harmful and is the result of the natural presence of sulfur and enzymes in garlic that react in an acidic environment.
The intensity of the hue comes from a wide range of factors, such as the age of the garlic when harvested and the chemistry of the soil. It is completely safe, non-toxic and is not a sign of deterioration. After a few years, the aged garlic cloves can take a uniform brown hue, the same color as balsamic vinegar.
Torshi seer and Nowruz
Garlic holds a very important place among all the traditions of the table of Nowruz (نوروز), also known as the Persian New Year.
The main tradition of Nowruz is Haft Sîn (هفت سین, seven “S”), seven objects whose name begins with the letter S or sîn (س) in the Persian alphabet. They are seven specific objects arranged on a table corresponding to the seven creations and the seven immortals protecting them. Every family tries to make the prettiest table of Haft Sin, especially for the spiritual side. 
Do not make the mistake of preparing a small batch of torshi seer. If you decide to prepare some, then go for a larger batch. Otherwise, you will have to make more as you get old, and you may never get a chance to taste them.
So… Let’s meet in 7, 10, or even 20 years!

I have a question about opening the jar to let the gas out … For the first week. Is it needed? Or do I just close it tightly and leave it to ferment in a cool/dark place? Also, if I’m using more than one jar … Should I put 3 cups of vinegar each jar with the amount of salt recommended or what? 
Thank you for the recipe.

Hello Sara 
You shouldn’t let any gas out. Just leave the jar unopened for a few months at least. For the amount of vinegar, just follow the ratios based on your jar sizes. Enjoy!

Once I make it can it be stored in a fridge? I live in a very humid place.

Teresa, you can, but they will not keep as long. Never tried, but I’d say a few weeks in the refrigerator.

Mike 
What do you recommend for a lid? I use mason jars and put wax paper over the jar. But the vinegar still corroded the lid and the vinegar evaporated out of the jar.

Never had that issue Scott, but I’d say to use some kind of cheesecloth or thin canvas (hessian or burlap). Good luck!

A company called Krautsource sells mason jar lids and bands made of stainless steel. Pricey but they don’t corrode.

I was taught to cover the jar with cheesecloth and refill as the vinegar evaporates. Any comments?

Yes Lisa, you can use this technique to allow the fermentation gases to evaporate, especially at the beginning of the process.

I’m having to open the jar to fill it with vinegar every 2-3 weeks because so much vinegar evaporates. Is that ok and is there a way to stop it from evaporating so much? I’m planning on waiting 15 years before eating. At what point does it need to be refrigerated?

If the jar is properly sealed, the vinegar should not evaporate.

I started some in 2015. I opened it today and all the vinegar was evaporated. It tasted ok. So I am going to refill with vinegar. I don’t know if this is ok or not.

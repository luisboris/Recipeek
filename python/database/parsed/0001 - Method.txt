First of all prepare the dough: pour the water, the extra virgin olive oil, the sugar and the crumbled yeast in a bowl, then start adding gradually the sifted flours while mixing. When the dough it’s almost done add the salt, and keep working for about 10 minutes. I also suggest to do 2-3 series of folding, every 15 minutes. Then place it in a bowl greased with some olive oil, and let it rest at room temperature for about 6-8 hours.
Before taking the maturated dough, cut the tomatoes into big slices and remove the seeds. Wash out also the salt from the salt-cured fish.
Divide the dough into 2 pieces (or not, if you want to make a bigger one in an oven tray), and flatten it with your hands (not too thick), on a working table where you have sprinkled enough flour. First add the pilchards/anchovies, then the minced garlic, the tomatoes, a lot of dried oregano (but without exaggerating) and for last the freshly grated Pecorino and a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil.
Let it rest other 30 minutes, then bake at 220 °C, static oven, for about 20-25 minutes. I did it directly over a pizza stone, if you do it on a tray don’t forget to grease the bottom.
Enjoy, if you want you can add some extra oregano also after it’s ready

tep by step method
Step 1 
Place the flour on the pastry board, add salt and put lard in the center, mixing it with a little warm water. Work the ingredients to obtain a smooth and compact dough, that you will let rest for 30 min.
Step 2 
In a large pan, saut√© in the oil the meat cut into small pieces, together with the sausage and onion. 
Step 3 
After a few minutes over low heat, add the other ingredients and let them brown for a few minutes; if necessary, soften the mixture with a little water so as not to make it too dry.
Step 4 
Peel and cut into small cubes the potatoes.
Step 5 
Roll out the dough with a rolling pin and make a lot of discs with a glass; place the filling (meet and potatoes) in the center of each one and close it with another disk of dough, passing the toothed wheel over the edges. Brush the impanadas with the egg yolk and bake them for half an hour (or until they are golden on the surface) at 180 degrees.

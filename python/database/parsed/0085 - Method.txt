Instructions
Place the flour in a shallow bowl, the eggs in another and the breadcrumbs in a third.
Dredge a slice of cheese in the flour.
Then dip it in the beaten eggs, submerging it to wet it all over.
Finally cover with bread crumbs, making sure the cheese slice is completely coated.
Repeat the same operation with the egg and bread crumbs. The double coating ensures the cheese does not leak when frying.
Set aside on a plate and repeat with the other slices of cheese.
Chill in the fridge for at least 30 minutes.
Czech tartar sauce (tatarská omáčka)
Meanwhile, prepare the tartare sauce by mixing together the mayonnaise, vinegar, mustard, gherkins, capers and onion in a small bowl. Season to taste with salt and pepper and set aside.
Heat the oil in a deep fryer or in a pan at medium/high heat until it reaches 350F/180C.
Deep fry the cheese slices for about 20 seconds.
Serve immediately with boiled potatoes or French fries, as well as tartar sauce.

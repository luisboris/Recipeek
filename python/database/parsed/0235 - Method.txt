STEP 4 - PREPARE SA PANADA
1. Roll out the dough into a thin sheet of about 2 to 3 mm.
2. Lay the dough in a previously greased (with olive oil) baking tray of 26 cm diameter, carefully making sure it adheres to the walls. 
3. Place the stuffing inside the panada dough, spreading it evenly.
4. Make sure to leave enough dough to seal the panada, and cut the excess.
5. Roll out the remaining dough and then use it to cover the panada, making sure the edges match.
6. With your fingertips, apply a light pressure to join the edges of the two discs, by gently pinching them. This is done to make sure the panada doesn't open during cooking.

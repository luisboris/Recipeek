Yield: serves 6
Ingredients
1 – 1 1⁄2 tbsp. coarse salt 
1 2⁄3 cups polenta 
1 tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil 
Instructions
1. Put salt into 7 cups cold water in a medium heavy pot. Add polenta and whisk in. Bring to a boil over high heat, stirring often; add oil, then reduce heat to medium and continue cooking, stirring often with a wooden spoon until polenta thickens and pulls away slightly from bottom and sides of pot, 20–40 minutes (depending on grind). 
2. Pour into a wet ceramic or glass mold, cool, turn out, and cut into pieces with a wet knife. Grill on a very hot, dry grill or sear in a nonstick skillet until golden brown.

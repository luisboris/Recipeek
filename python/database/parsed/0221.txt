How to make Sheet Pan Quesadillas:
Step 1: Preheat the oven to 425Â° F / 220Â° C.
Step 2: Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add onion and bell peppers, cook until soft for about 5 minutes. Remove from skillet and set aside in a small bowl.
Step 3: In the same skillet add ground beef and cook, breaking up meat until you get a brown color for about 5 minutes. Make sure to drain fat.
Step 4: Stir in paprika, chili powder, cumin, and season with salt and pepper to taste.
Step 5: Place 6 tortillas on a baking sheet, make sure to overlap the tortillas, and place another one to cover the baking sheet completely.
Step 6: Top with ground beef, then add pepper and onion mixture.
Step 7: Add shredded cheese and green onions on the top.
Step 8: Fold the tortillas towards the center and place another tortilla in the center on top of all fillings. If the tortillas donâ€™t stay in place, put a second baking sheet on top of it to help quesadilla hold its shape.
Step 9: Bake until tortillas are beginning to turn crispy, about 25-35 minutes. If you added a second baking sheet, remove it after 10 minutes and continue baking.
Step 10: Slice the quesadillas into rectangles and serve warm with sour cream and pico de gallo on the top.
Enjoy!

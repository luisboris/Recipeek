Bara brith recipe
Delicious when spread with salted butter, Bara brith is a rich fruit loaf made with tea. Here's our recipe for this traditional Welsh tea-time treat.
This is not the traditional recipe for bara brith, meaning ‘speckled bread’ as the original recipe was based on a yeasted bread. However this version which is widely served, makes a beautifully moist cake as the dried fruit are soaked overnight in tea. It's best stored for a couple of days before eating, allowing the flavours to develop. 
Serves 8-10 slices | Prep 15 minutes | Cook 1 hour
Ingredients
400g mixed fruit (e.g. sultanas, raisins, currants)
300ml strong hot tea 
250g self-raising flour 
1 tsp mixed spice 
100g dark brown muscovado sugar 
1 free range egg, beaten
Honey to glaze
Method
01 Put the dried fruit in a bowl and pour over the tea, mix in the sugar and stir well to dissolve. Leave to soak for at least 6 hours or overnight. 
02 Next day, sift the flour and spice into the soaked fruit (no need to drain the tea) and stir in the egg. Blend well together. 
03 Preheat the oven to 180°C /Gas 4. Line a 900g loaf tin with bakewell paper and pour in the mixture. 
04 Bake for approximately 1 hour until the cake has risen and cooked through. Leave to cool on a rack and store for 2 days before eating. Serve sliced with butter. 
05 This mixture can be doubled to make 2 loaves and will keep for up to 7 days.
06 Warm a little honey to drizzle over the surface of the warm cake for a glazed topping.

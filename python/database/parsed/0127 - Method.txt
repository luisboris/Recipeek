Instructions
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (180 degrees C). Wash 4-5 medium-sized tilapia fillets with water and pat them dry using a paper towel. Line the tilapia fillets on a 9×13 inch baking tray.
Note – if using frozen fillets, thaw them before using.
Stir together 1 tablespoon lemon juice, 3 tablespoon melted unsalted butter, 1 teaspoon minced garlic, ½ teaspoon hot paprika (or Kashmiri red chili powder), ½ teaspoon salt, and ½ teaspoon freshly cracked black pepper in a small mixing bowl.
Pour the marinade over the Tilapia fillets. Arrange 3-4 slices of lemon over the fish.
Bake uncovered for 15-20 minutes or until the fish is flaky and fork-tender. Garnish with pepper flakes, lemon slices, and chopped parsley or cilantro, and serve hot.

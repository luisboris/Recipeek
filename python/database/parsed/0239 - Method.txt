Instructions
In the bowl of a stand mixer, add the flour, ground cardamom, sugar, tikur azmud or habba sawda (Ethiopian nigella) or black sesame seeds and mix.
Dig a well in the center of this mixture, add the flour in the center of this well and add 1 cup (250 ml) of lukewarm water.
Leave to rest for 15 minutes.
Add the melted niter kibbeh and start kneading at low to medium speed while incorporating the rest of the lukewarm water very gradually until you obtain a soft and homogeneous dough that comes off the sides of the bowl.
Add salt and knead at medium speed for 5 minutes.
On a lightly floured work surface, roll out the dough and place it, covered with a cloth, in a warm place, away from drafts, for 90 minutes so it can rise.
At the end of the first rise, knock back the dough on a lightly floured work surface and divide it into two dough pieces.
Roll out the two dough pieces into a circle about 12 inches (30 cm) in diameter.
Place each circle in a round baking pan, such as a pizza pan.
Cover the two himbasha, and place them in a warm, draft-free place for 10 minutes, for a second rise.
Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 350 F (175Â°C).
Using a sharp knife, or cookie cutters of different sizes, mark 4 to 5 concentric circles on the first loaf, working from the center to the edges, then make cuts intersecting in the center to form a wheel pattern.
On the second loaf, make decorative patterns.
Froth the milk and melted kibbeh niter (or olive oil) in a bowl.
Brush the himbasha with this mixture and bake for 25 to 35 minutes until cooked through and golden brown.

Bagara baingan recipe With step by step photos – Bagara baingan is a
delicious dish made with small aubergines. A Vegan Dish.
![bagara baingan recipe][5]![bagara baingan recipe][6]
It is a popular vegetarian recipe from the Hyderabadi cuisine and goes very
well with biryani varieties or rotis or rice. This brinjal gravy is often made
to serve as a side dish with biryani.
India is a country with multi cuisines. we all know that the North Indian
cuisine is different from South Indian cuisine, but even the cuisines of the
different parts of south India are different from each other. You see the
cuisine of Karnataka is different from the Kerala cuisine.
Even amongst the same states there are many differences. One such state is
Andhra Pradesh. And it has both the Andhra cuisine and the Hyderabadi cuisine
and they both are very different from each other. Thanks to the nizams of
Hyderabad who have invented this rich cuisine – the Hyderabadi cuisine is very
popular in India as well as outside India too.
The faded memory of learning to make Bagara baingan in my home science
course days – is just that – faded. I had forgotten the existence of this
recipe till a few years back one of my Hyderabadi office colleagues told me
about the recipe – again it disappeared into oblivion.
The bagara baingan recipe came to my head after a long long gap, when I had
some fresh small aubergines with me and did not know which style to cook it.
The Punjabi way or the Goan way.
Finally a book came to my help and I adapted this recipe from Chandra
Padmanabhan’s cookbook “simply south: traditional vegetarian cooking”.
This book has many good recipes. Varieties of South Indian sambar, rasam and
vegetable & rice recipes. It also covers our regulars idli, masala dosa and
chutneys plus some South Indian snacks and sweets. A few recipes I tried from
this book and they were very good.
The bagara baingan recipe was very good and came out very well. It goes
well with biryani or rotis or rice. This Hyderabadi baingan recipe and the
Goan/Konkani Recipe of stuffed brinjal has 3 of my favorite ingredients in
them: coconut, sesame seeds, peanuts.
How to make bagara baingan
1\. Rinse 250 grams small sized baingan (aubergines or brinjal) 2 to 3 times
in water.
![bagara baingan recipe][7]![bagara baingan recipe][8]
2\. Quarter the baingans (aubergines or brinjal) and soak them in salted water
for 15-20 minutes. drain the baingan after 15-20 minutes.
![bagara baingan recipe][7]![bagara baingan recipe][9]
3\. Meanwhile take the following spices – 2 tablespoons raw peanuts, 2
tablespoons white sesame seeds, 1 teaspoon poppy seeds, 1 teaspoon coriander
seeds, 1 teaspoon cumin seeds, 2 inch cinnamon stick, 2 to 3 cloves, 1
tejpatta (Indian bay leaf), ½ teaspoon whole peppercorns, ½ teaspoon caraway
seeds (shahi jeera) and 1 to 2 black cardamoms.

4\. Heat a pan and keep the flame to a low. Add all the spices. Stir and begin
to saute them. Saute them till they become aromatic and light brown.

Like many of you know, I love pork chops, particularly in the crockpot, and this Crockpot Ranch Pork Chops recipe is good. This recipe for the crockpot ranch pork chops is a favorite in the family. We enjoy trying a new recipe for dinner, and this one is not a failure. It is also a good meal even when you freeze it. Mix the ingredients and try the pork chops with mushroom soup cream of chicken soup cream for more delicious meal ideas.
Many foods cannot be better by adding ranch seasoning, and this slow cooker chops for pork is no exception. This family-favored dinner’s secret is simple: just a pack of ranch dressing and seasoning mix and a creamy mushroom soup can.

Crockpot Ranch Pork Chops Recipe
Ingredients:_
1 pound pork chops, loin, center-cut
1) packet Ranch dip and seasoning mix
1 cup of water
1) can (98%) fat-free cream of chicken
Salt and pepper, to taste
P.S. you can add potatoes.
Directions:_
Season the chops of pork with salt and pepper and put them in the crockpot.
In a bowl, combine the Ranch mixture, water, and chicken cream, and pour over the chops into a crockpot.
Cook for 5-7 hours over the low heat.
Serving Size: Makes four servings, each with one pork chop
Tip:
Despite this, baked potatoes and green beans are among our favorite side dishes. For this recipe, the sauce is so fantastic and makes it much tastier. Brown rice and steamed broccoli are other ideas. They are so fast and so tasty. Keep it, and serve a simple side dish to make a quick dinner. Our family loves just one of these I always make use of what I already have or can find on offer.

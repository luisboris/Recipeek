INSTRUCTIONS
1. Preheat the oven to 400F.
2. Take a bowl(large) and add the cream of tartar and egg whites. Until stiff peaks form, whip with a hand mixer.
3. Take another bowl and with a hand mixer, mix the mayonnaise, egg yolks, garlic and parsley for a minute.
4. Into the yolk mixture, gently fold the firm meringue in 3-4 batches. So the mixture is still firm and foamy, try to deflate the meringue as little as possible.
5. Add like a ¼ cup of the foam, on One or Two baking sheets that are covered with parchment paper, to make Twelve even circles. To spread the mixture, you can also use a spoon so that it looks more like a circle.
6. Place in the oven and bake for Twenty mins. Remove from oven and before picking them off the parchment paper, let completely cool.
7. In the fridge, store in a plastic bag.
NOTES
It won’t whip, so make sure you don’t put any egg yolks in the egg whites!
Just replace the mayo for sour cream or cream cheese if you want a dairy version.

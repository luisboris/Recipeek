Homemade Falafel
1]
By Lindsay Funston
Nov 24, 2020 
Falafel is in our top 5 favorite sandwich stuffers. And although nothing's faster than picking up a sandwich from your favorite falafel joint, we promise that making these falafel balls at home is a cinch. These are herby, savory and the crispy outside give ways to a perfectly tender and spicy interior. Bonus: Except for being fried, falafel is actually very healthy! A perfect meal for vegetarians, and it's even vegan if you opt for tahini instead of the yogurt sauce.
Can I make the falafel mixture ahead?
Yes! In fact, resting the mixture overnight could even help when it comes to forming the balls. You can make the mixture up to 3 days in advance. Just be sure to refrigerate it in an airtight container until ready to use.
How long do they keep once they're fried?
Like most fried things, falafel is obviously the tastiest when freshly cooked. Kept in an airtight container in the fridge, it can last up to 3 days. In a pinch, it can be microwaved. If you really want to bring it back to life, though, try toasting the balls in a toaster oven (or regular oven) until warmed through in the center and slightly crisp on the outside.
What can I serve with falafel besides pita?
Falafel is SUPER versatile. A simple salad with chopped veggies dressed in tahini sauce and topped with falafel makes a delicious lunch or dinner. You could also try replacing the pita with lettuce wraps, or simply eat the falafel balls on their own! (Maybe with some Greek feta dip on the side? 😏)

Directions
1. In a food processor fitted with a metal blade, combine chickpeas, garlic, shallot, parsley, cumin, coriander, and flour and season with salt and pepper. Pulse until mixture is coarse and mealy—do not over blend!
2. Form mixture into falafel balls about 2" in diameter, squeezing to compact. Transfer to chill in the refrigerator while oil heats.
3. In a pot, heat 1” vegetable oil until a drop of water added to the oil sizzles and pops.
4. Fry falafels until golden, then transfer to a paper towel-lined plate and season immediately with salt.
5. To make yogurt sauce: In a medium bowl, whisk together yogurt, lemon juice, oil, and dill. Season with salt and pepper.
6. To make tahini sauce: In a medium bowl, whisk together tahini, garlic, lemon juice, and warm water. Season with salt. (If you prefer a thinner sauce, whisk in more warm water 1 tablespoon at a time.)
7. Serve falafels in pita with lettuce, tomatoes, and cucumber and drizzle with either sauce.

DIRECTIONS
Combine cornstarch and water in a small cup and stir well.
Add milk to a soup pan or dutch oven pot.
Stir in cornstarch mixture in milk before it gets warm.
Add in vanilla and sugar.
Must stir constantly until it comes to a boil.
Let boil for 2 minutes, meanwhile still stirring.
Serve in dessert bowls.
Top with cinnamon and coconut or just chopped pistachios.
It's traditionally eaten hot, but I like it cold too, once it cooled off and firmed up.
Enjoy!

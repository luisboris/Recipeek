Popular throughout Latin America and Spain, _alfajores_ are shortbread-like
sandwich cookies filled with dulce de leche, and rolled in grated coconut.
What are alfajores?
The _alfajor_ (or _alajú_ ) is one of the foremost ambassadors of South
American and Spanish pastries. It is also found in the Philippines and in the
South of France.
This delicious confection consists of two or more layers of cookies, joined by
a filling generally made of fruit or milk jam, honey, chocolate mousse, or
even dried fruit or nut pastes, such as almonds, walnuts or hazelnuts.
However, coconut and dulce de leche are the most common.
The use of spices, such as anise, sesame, cilantro, cloves and cinnamon is
also common.

Alfajores are a national icon in South America and Spain and have so many
versions that they can satisfy any palate.
What is the origin of alfajores?
According to Manuel Alvar López (1923 – 2001), eminent philologist,
dialectologist and Spanish professor in his “Manual de dialectología
hispánica”, and his field studies, compiled in his linguistic and ethnographic
atlases, the alfajor in clearly of Andalusian origins, at the time of Al-
Andalus.
Andalusia (Andalucía), is an autonomous community made up of eight provinces,
located in southern Spain.
Al-Andalus is the term which designates all the territories of the Iberian
Peninsula and some of the South of France, such as Septimania, which were
under Muslim domination between 711 and 1492, when Grenada was taken.
Andalusia today, which takes its name from it, was for a long time only a
small part.
In 712, General Abu Abderrahman Moussa ibn Noçaïr ibn Abderrahman Zayd al-
Bakri al-Lajmi, better known under the name of Moussa ibn Noçaïr (640 – 716 in
Syria) who participated in the Muslim conquest of the Iberian Peninsula,
arrived in Algeciras, in Spain, with an army of 18,000 soldiers and types of
alfajores, to undertake the conquest of Medina Sidonia, Alcalá de Guadaira and
Carmona.
According to Manuel Alvar López, the word “alfajor” is an Andalusian variant
of the Castilian word “alajú”, itself derived from the Arabic word الفاخر,
“al-fakher”, meaning “luxurious”, and was introduced to Latin America as
“alfajor”.
The word had, in fact, been introduced into Spanish dictionaries in the 14th
century and especially in 1492, in Antonio de Nebrija’s famous 28,000-word
work, the “Lexicon hoc est Dictionarium ex sermone latino in hispaniensem”,
better known under the title “Diccionario latino-español” (Nebrija’s Latin-
Spanish dictionary).
We also find a similar cake called alajú in the book “Kitab al-Tabikh” or
“Kitab al-Ṭabīḫ” (Arabic: كتاب الطبيخ, “The book of dishes”), the name of two
medieval Arab cookbooks from Baghdad. Kitab al- Tabikh, written in the 10th
century by Ibn Sayyar al-Warraq, and Kitab al-Ṭabīḫ written in 1226 by
Muhammad bin Hasan al-Baghdadi.
The first references to appear in South America and, more particularly, in
Venezuela and Peru at the beginning of the 18th century, referred to a
confection served to the Spanish troops, then accommodated as a dessert in the
region of Rio de la Plata, by the Andalusian immigrants.
The Río de la Plata, which in Spanish means “Silver River”, is the estuary
formed by the Uruguay River and the funnel-shaped Paraná River on the southern
coast of South America.
In the province of Río de la Plata, alfajores were introduced around the 19th
century by a French pioneer, Auguste Chammas (1801 – 1870), a perfumer and
chemist in Paris and then a confectioner in Cordoba, Argentina.
Chammas landed in 1840 on the coasts of the region and, in 1869, founded a
small family industry making jams and types of alfajores. This industry was
the first to make this dessert in the form we know today.
Alfajores therefore have Arab origins, moreover, it should be noted that
Spanish culinary experts have highlighted the resemblance between alfajores
and maamoul, a butter confectionery containing a date paste sprinkled with
sugar and popular in North Africa and the Middle East, and especially in
Lebanon.

The main variants
Spain  
In Spain there is a wide variety of alfajores recipes, but the more
traditional ones contain flour, honey, almonds and several spices, such as
cinnamon.
_Alfajor de Murcia_ , a town located in the south-eastern part of Spain. This
very old dessert has maintained all the Arab tradition, but is only made in
the northeast of the region, and mainly in Pedanías altas de Lorca.
Cylindrical in shape, its flavor is composed of a mixture of almonds, walnuts,
honey and cinnamon.
_Alfajor de Medina-Sidonia,_ in the province of Cadiz, Andalusia, southwestern
Spain. Medina Sidonia was the capital of the Arab world of clothing, where the
alfajor has many centuries of history with a recipe that has been passed down
from generation to generation.
The certification body responsible for promoting local products has jealously
watched over the quality and know-how of the alfajor of Medina-Sidonia for 500
years. It is an alfajor that comes in a cylindrical shape, and weighs about 1
lb (500 g); it is decorated with dried fruits and topped with honey flavored
with cinnamon.
In Medina Sidonia, the annual production of around 99,000 lbs (45,000 kg) is
mainly consumed in the province of Cadiz, but alfajores are also popular in
Seville, Malaga and Huelva.
_Alfajor de Cuenca and Alcarria_ , in the region of Madrid, located in the
central part of the country. In this region, this dessert is still often
called alajú. It is prepared mainly from flour, almonds, figs and honey.
South America  
In South America, alfajores are popular in Argentina, Uruguay, Ecuador,
Paraguay, Bolivia, Chile, Colombia, Peru, Brazil, and Venezuela.
Argentina  
Alfajores have been made since colonial times in the territories that are now
part of Argentina. According to the “Código Alimentario Argentino” (Argentine
Food Code), alfajores should be prepared as follows:
“ _Se entiende por Alfajor el producto constituido por dos o más galletitas,
galletas o masas horneadas, adheridas entre sí por productos, tales como
mermeladas, jaleas, dulces u otras sustancias o mezclas de sustancias
alimenticias de uso permitido. Podrán estar revestidos parcial o totalmente
por coberturas, o baños de repostería u otras sustancias to contain frutas
secas enteras o partidas, coco rallado o adornos cuyos constituyentes se
encuentren admitidos en el presente Código. (…)_ ”- Article 761 bis.
Meaning:  
“ _Alfajor is understood to mean a product composed of two or more cookies,
biscuits or cooked dough, stuck to each other by products, such as jams,
jellies, confectionery or other substances or mixtures of food substances for
authorized use. They may be partially or totally covered by coatings,
couverture, or other substances to contain whole or split dried fruits, grated
coconut or ornaments whose constituents are admitted in this Code. (…)_ ”-
Article 761 bis.
Among the Argentinian regional alfajores, we find _cordovan_ , filled with
fruit confectionery, more generally quince, _santafesino_. No less than three
layers of puff pastry stuck together with lots of dulce de leche and all with
icing.
Also in Santa Fe we find rogel, with the same characteristics, but bigger and
_tucumano_ , also known as _clarita_ , made of crunchy cookies and a sweet
filling made from honey and cane sugar.
Also in Argentina, _alfajores de coricena_ , made with cornstarch, dulce de
leche as a filling, and grated coconut around the join, are very popular.
Paraguay  
Alfajor is one of the most typical cookies of Paraguay, where they are usually
made with flour or cassava starch and dulce de leche as a filling.
Peru  
The classic presentation consists of two discs of flour and / or cornstarch
dough, connected by a layer of _manjar blanco_ and sprinkled with icing sugar.
There are multiple variations of alfajores in Peru, including the most
prominent, at least for its size, _King Kong de manjar blanco_ , from
Lambayeque, typical of northern Peru. It is made with cookies (made from
flour, butter, eggs and milk), filled with Peruvian manjar blanco, pineapple
confectionery and, in some cases, peanuts. It weighs 1 -2 lbs (500 g to 1k g)
and is known as part of the culture of the Lambayeque region, located in the
northwest of the country.
Another Peruvian variety, a specialty of the north coast, is _algarrobina
alfajor_ , made from syrup of carob tree pods.
In Peru there are regional varieties such as:
Alfajores from Cajamarca, a region located in the highlands of northern
Peru: they are usually prepared in two different ways, but with some
similarities. Unlike other alfajores from Cajamarca, they are made with
reduced thickness of less than ½ inch (1 cm), but larger in diameter. They
are usually 4 inches (10 cm) in diameter, or more. There is a baked form,
and another fried.
_Alfajores arequipeños_ , from the region of Arequipa, a Peruvian city,
capital of the homonymous province and of the homonymous department,
located in the Peruvian Andes. The cookies are made with corn and wheat
flour and filled with honey.
_Alfajores moqueguanos,_ from Moquegua the region of Moquegua, south of
Lima: they are similar to the Arequipa alfajores. There are also a few
alfajores called _moquehua_ in Yapatera, filled with honey or manjar
blanco.
_Alfajores de penco._ Formerly called _alfajores de yemas_ (eggs). They
are much larger than regular alfajores, with three layers of dough made
with egg yolks, anise, baking soda, and flour, while the filling is manjar
blanco, to which are added coconut, peanuts, chestnuts and honey.
Mexico  
In Mexico, alfajores are made with coconut only and are normally a tricolor
coconut confectionery.
Nicaragua  
In Nicaragua, they are made with molasses and various grains, including corn
and cocoa. They are often wrapped in plastic or waxed paper.
Brazil  
The Brazilian style of alfajores is commonly referred to as _bem-casado_
(literally “well married”), also filled with milk jam and dusted with icing
sugar.
There is also another cake known as _pão de mel,_ meaning “honey bread” in
Portuguese, which shares some characteristics with bem-casado, but looks more
like gingerbread. This variety is coated in dark chocolate, just like in
Argentina and Uruguay, but has a cake-like texture on the inside and can be
filled with milk jam, chocolate, and coconut cream.
Other varieties include different ingredients in the preparation of the cookie
dough, such as peanuts, and a variety of fillings, coatings, or even the
addition of a third cookie ( _triple alfajor_ ).
Chile  
Alfajores from the central zone of Chile are consumed all year round. On the
other hand, in the city of Valdivia, in the Region of Los Ríos, in the south
of the country, it is generally consumed for the celebrations of National
Holidays.
They are also called _chilenitos_ and are made with cornstarch or some other
type of flour and are generally simpler and smaller than common alfajores.
Although the term, alfajor, is also often used for two cookies united by a
sweetness and usually dipped in meringue or jam and optionally sprinkled with
icing sugar, the real traditional Chilean alfajor is made with two sheets of a
kind of biscuit with a firm and very fine texture, which, when baked, have a
curved shape at two of their ends, like tiles, traditionally joined with
_chancaca_ or manjar blanco. They can also be garnished on the edge with
grated coconut or ground nuts.

2. Blend the onions, garlic, galangal, ginger, lemongrass, dried chilli paste and dried shrimp.
3. In a pot, add some oil and saut√© the blended paste and curry powder on low heat. Once fragrant, add in the blended fish and stir to combine.
4. Add in the coconut milk and kerisik and stir well. Add tamarind slices, sugar and salt to taste. Keep stirring and add water at this stage.
5. Let the mixture simmer on low heat for 1-2 hours until oil appears on the surface and colour is orangey-brown and the texture of the gravy is quite thick. Remove from heat.
6. In a pot, cook the spaghetti until al dente. Plunge into cold water. Take a handful of pasta strands, and make a knot.

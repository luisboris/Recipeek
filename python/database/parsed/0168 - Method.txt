Instructions
Preparation for falafel
Wash and soak chickpeas for overnight or at least for 6 hours. 
Discard the water and rinse them well. Drain them to a colander.
Process together chickpeas, cumin, coriander, pepper, cayenne, salt, onion, garlic, parsley and flour to a coarse mixture. 
The mixture must resemble wheat semolina or couscous.
If the mixture is not processed well the balls can break in the oil. Refrigerate for an hour if possible. 
Heat oil in a deep pan just enough to half immerse the falafel. 
The trick i found to prevent the falafels from disintegrating is to use oil just enough to half immerse them.
Optional : Make a very small ball and drop it in the hot oil to check if it is binding well. It should not break or fall apart. 
If it breaks, then add more flour or process the mixture a bit more.
Frying falafel
Make lemon sized balls and press them gently to bind the mixture well. 
If you have added flour then you may slightly flatten them.
Gently slide them one after the other to the hot oil. Do not disturb them for a minute or two. 
Deep fry them on a medium flame until golden & crisp. Remove the falafel to a steel colander or kitchen towel. 
Serve falafel with favorite dip or as a stuffing in pita bread or wraps.

Pan-Roasted Honey Lime Chicken Thighs - one of the best chicken thigh recipes you'll ever try! Easy, delicious, simple ingredients.
I love cooking chicken thighs - they are so easy to handle, and always come out moist and juicy. Can't really go wrong with this cut of meat. You'll love this simple recipe - perfect for a quick, weeknight dinner, and very budget-friendly too! 
Often, chicken thigh recipes involve baking the thighs in the oven, but here I am browning the chicken in a large skillet on the stove top, then add honey-lime mixture to the same skillet and let the thighs cook in its own juices on lower heat for about 20 minutes. During the cooking process the chicken thighs release their juices which get mixed in with the honey-lime mixture to produce really delicious sauce which you will then drizzle over the chicken before serving. You can also drizzle these pan juices over a side dish, such as rice. YUM! By the way, if you need an idea for a yummy side dish recipe, here is a rice recipe which will be perfect with these chicken thighs: Cilantro-Lime Black Bean Rice.
Also, many people really like chicken thigh recipes with cilantro and lime, and I have a great recipe for you that has all the ingredients you'll love, everything is cooked in one-pan, which makes the clean-up a breeze. Check it out: Chicken Thighs with Cilantro-Lime Black Bean Rice.

Ingredients
4 tablespoons lime juice freshly squeezed
2 tablespoons honey
1 tablespoon soy sauce
7 chicken thighs (about 7 or 8 chicken thighs, depends on the size of your skillet)
Â½ teaspoon salt
2 tablespoon olive oil
2 green onions chopped
1 lime sliced (for garnish only)
Instructions 
In a small bowl combine lime juice, honey, soy sauce.
Salt the chicken thighs with Â½ teaspoon of salt (or more) thoroughly, all over, including under the skin.
In 12-inch skillet, heat olive oil over medium-high heat. Add chicken thighs, skin side down, and cook for about 5 minutes until the chicken skin side gets nicely browned (make sure to get really nice brown, not just pale brown - it makes a difference in presentation).
Turn chicken, so that skins sides are up and add lime-honey mixture to the skillet. Reduce heat to low; cover and cook 14 to 18 minutes longer or until done (chicken should register 180 degrees F on instant thermometer). While cooking, covered, chicken thighs will release their own juices, as well.
Transfer chicken to plates. Drizzle chicken with pan juices. Top with chopped green onions and serve with lime slices.

This was so simple to make - and was very tasty! I used the juice of 3 small limes (about 6 tablespoons) but kept the honey and soy sauce the same as in your recipe. Served with brown rice and garlic roasted broccolini and asparagus. I also used boneless/skinless thighs. Very tasty meal and the pan juices on the rice and veggies were perfect! Thank you!

How do the cooking times change when using boneless, skinless chicken thighs?
Reply

Cook them for about the same time, about 20 minutes, and slice one in the middle to see if it's cooked through.

I have made this recipe several times and we really enjoy it! Thank you. I'm wanting to make it tonight for a larger group of people. I'm wondering if making in the slow cooker or baking in the oven might work just as well. Have you every tried?

Karen, so glad you've been enjoying this recipe. You can bake these in the oven. 
Preheat oven to 350 F. 
First, sear the chicken thighs on the stove-top. Heat 2 tablespoons of vegetable oil on medium-high heat in a large skillet. Add chicken thighs skin-side down. Cook for about 5 minutes, on the skin side until nicely browned. 
Transfer chicken thighs, skin side up, to the foil-lined baking sheet and bake at 350 F for about 20 minutes or until chicken thighs are completely cooked through and no longer pink in the center. 
Then, make the honey-lime sauce and add cooked chicken thighs.

This is very vague. After baking the chicken thighs, do we put it back in the pan? Do we the honey lime sauce while the chicken is in the oven?
Reply
September 22, 2021 at 4:18 pm
There is no oven involved. Everything is cooked on the stovetop.

Where is the cilantro? It's called cilantro lime honey chicken?
Reply
February 16, 2022 at 2:56 pm
There is no cilantro in title

Taste combinations were excellent. Makes a really nice Saturday evening supper. ( You have to be really careful not to overcook the soy / lime / honey sauce.

Could I transfer the chicken/sauce to a baking dish prior to baking? I currently donâ€™t have a pan I can put straight into the oven.
Reply

Mine didnâ€™t turn out this way. Should I drain the oil in the pan after browning the skin? Very watery sauce and not very much lime or honey taste.
Reply
August 13, 2021 at 10:07 pm
Yes, you can drain the oil, if you like.
Reply

Seems like it would be a good idea to tell your readers to drain some of the fats out of the pan before adding the lime juice honey and soy sauce mixture.

It has calories but not how may pieces is a serving size. Is it just one piece for serving. If do thats lots of calories.
Reply

It says 4 servings and lists 8 thighs so 2 thighs is a serving.

Yes, correct!

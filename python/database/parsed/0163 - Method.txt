How To Make carrot-cumin pilaf
1. Gently warm the vegetable broth, bay leaves and oregano sprigs in a saucepan over medium-low heat.
2. Heat up the olive oil in a large deep skillet over medium heat. Add the minced shallots, cooking until softened and lightly golden, about 3-4 minutes.
3. Next add the Texmati rice and cumin seeds; cook until the rice is opaque and the cumin seeds are fragrant, about 4 minutes.
4. Stir in the carrot rounds and salt.
5. Pour the warmed broth into the rice mixture. Stir, bring to a BOIL, cover and reduce heat to a simmer. If using brown Texmati rice, you will have to cook the rice for about 45-50 minutes. If using standard Texmati or basmati, cook for about 20 minutes.
6. Remove skillet from burner and set aside, covered for 10 minutes.
7. Taste and adjust seasoning if desired, fluff with fork and serve.

Instructions
1. Soak the rice in cold water for 15 minutes or until you are easily able to break one grain of rice between your thumb and index fingers. When ready, drain well.
2. Meanwhile, heat 1 tablespoon of olive oil in a heavy cooking pot. Add chopped red onions, cook on medium-high heat briefly, then add the ground beef. Season the meat mixture with 1 ¼ teaspoon allspice, minced garlic, ½ teaspoon ground cloves, ½ teaspoon ground cinnamon, salt and pepper. Toss together to combine. Cook until the meat is fully browned (8-10 minutes). Drain.
3. Top the meat with rice. Season the rice with a little salt and the remainder of the allspice, ground cloves and cinnamon. Add 2 ½ cups of water and 1 tablespoon of olive oil to cover the rice.
4. Turn heat to high and bring the liquid to a rolling boil. Let boil until the liquid has significantly reduced (see picture below).
5. Now turn heat to low and cover; let cook for 20 minutes or until moisture has completely been absorbed and the rice is no longer hard nor sticky. Remove from heat and set aside for 10 minutes.
6. Uncover the rice pot and place a large round serving platter on the opening of the rice pot. Carefully flip the pot contents onto the platter so that the meat layer now tops the rice.
7. Garnish with parsley, toasted pine nuts, almonds and raisins. Enjoy.

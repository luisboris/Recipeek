Homemade Ranch Seasoning Mix

Newsflash for ranch lovers! Did you know that it is super duper easy to make delicious ranch seasoning mix _homemade_ _?_
True story. No need to run to the store for one of those processed packets, or to pick up a jar of your favorite ranch dressing or dip. All of the ingredients are likely sitting right there in your spice cabinet! Just do a little measuring, a little mixing, and you’re ready to make your favorite ranch dressing or dip or whatever other ranch-ness you may love in less than 5 minutes. It is seriously that easy!
The great thing too about homemade ranch seasoning is that it won’t be full of un-pronounceable mystery ingredients. Just your simple herbs and spices, and some optional powdered buttermilk if you’d like (similar to powdered milk).
I love using mine to make skinny Greek yogurt ranch dip, ranch dressing, or I’ll even just use the mix to season some chicken or fries. Delish!!!

Description
Delicious ranch seasoning mix is super easy to make homemade!
Ingredients
Scale 1x2x3x
2 tablespoons dried parsley
2 teaspoons dried dill
2 teaspoons garlic powder
2 teaspoons onion powder
2 teaspoons dried onion flakes
1 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 teaspoon dried chives
1 teaspoon fine sea salt
optional: 1/3 cup buttermilk powder_
Instructions
1. Whisk all ingredients together until blended. If you want a more finely-ground seasoning mix, you can pulse the mixture in a food processor until it reaches your desired consistency.
2. Store in a sealed container for up to 1 year. (If using the buttermilk powder, refrigerate in a sealed container for up to 1 month.)
Notes
Buttermilk powder: If you would like to make ranch seasoning that is identical to the stuff sold in the packet, you can add buttermilk powder to this recipe. Otherwise, you can just add fresh buttermilk if you are turning this seasoning into ranch dressing.
Store-bought equivalent: Approximately 3 tablespoons of this mix (made with the buttermilk powder mixed in) equals 1 packet of the store-bought ranch seasoning mix.
To make ranch dressing: Combine 1 tablespoon ranch seasoning mix (including buttermilk powder) + 1/3 cup mayo + 1/3 cup milk, and whisk to combine.

I like this better than store-bought ranch dressing.
2. Jennifer — November 9, 2019 @ 5:24 pm Reply
I’m curious why this has to be stored in the refrigerator…I don’t see any ingredients in it that require refrigeration.
Chad Ewing — April 2, 2020 @ 10:26 pm 
Refrigerating it extends the shelf life, especially if you’ve added the dry buttermilk powder.
Francine — January 9, 2022 @ 4:23 am 
Because dried buttermilk has to be refrigerated.
3. Renee SHREWSBURY — February 17, 2020 @ 4:02 pm Reply
How much of this mix is equal to 1 packet?
Chad Ewing — April 2, 2020 @ 10:27 pm 
Three tablespoons.

I can’t thank you enough for this recipe! It is now my staple that I add to blended cottage cheese, Greek yogurt, or kefir cheese, along with carmelized onion, chopped artichokes, Bleu cheese, goat cheese or whatever, to dip veggies into. I do not refrigerate it … just keep it in a sealed jar … and it lasts for months.
Fran — December 21, 2021 @ 9:34 am 
Can you share your recipe for the Dip you refer too in this posting?
5. Debby Granberg — March 21, 2020 @ 2:09 pm Reply
I tried this mix with the suggested 1 T mix, 1/3 c may and 1/3 c sour cream. I found it too thick. Any suggestions?
Sunshine’s mom — April 1, 2020 @ 3:30 am 
Why don’t you just thin it out with more milk?
Laura Etheridge — July 17, 2020 @ 8:24 pm 
I’ve been using whey left from making Greek yogurt and it’s perfect because of the light tangy flavor it lends to the mix. Maybe thining regular yogurt with water would yield same result if you don’t have whey.

This is so good! Better than the packet and FAR less expensive to make. I added a couple T of sour cream for a ranch dip. Thank you!

Love this recipe. My friend can’t have dairy, so I make a thick cashew cream (1 cup cashews, 1 1/2 cup water blended in a vitamix till smooth) and add this mix without the powdered buttermilk, and let it sit over night. If it’s too thick, I add a little more water. She devours this as a fresh veggie dip. Thank you for posting it!

In the picture shown, are those scallions or chives?
Ali — April 28, 2020 @ 7:49 am 
Dried chives :)
9. Bree — April 28, 2020 @ 7:35 pm Reply
SO good!!!! We started using this as a substitute for the store bought mix for roasts and now we won’t even buy ranch dressing as this recipe is awesome!

Is Buttermilk Powder the same as Saco Buttermilk Blend? I can’t seem to find anything called Buttermilk Powder. Thanks
Francine — January 9, 2022 @ 4:24 am 
Yes

Can you simply hang and dry all herbs from the garden? Kinda novice at that aspect. We live in a colder climate and growing season is very short. Grocery store is very expensive in winter for herbs. Any advice would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!
Louise Hale — May 31, 2021 @ 10:56 am 
I dry all my own home grown herbs and use them all winter!
12. Michele — June 28, 2020 @ 4:24 pm Reply
This was easy to make with everything I have in my spice drawer. I do think it needs more salt, though. I made the salad dressing with 1/3 c milk and mayo- it was pretty thin. I added another 1/3 c sour cream and that made it perfect. Thanks! I did use the buttermilk powder!
13. Jessie — July 16, 2020 @ 11:17 am Reply
I have a daughter with a diary allergy. As she’s getting bigger and transitioning from baby food to table food, I’m trying to make my kitchen completely dairy free. Dry Ranch seasoning is something I use a LOT, but I thought we were just gonna have to give it up. But I made your recipe using powdered almond milk, and it’s wonderful! It’s not exactly the same taste as the store stuff, but I think this tastes better, and it’s healthier! I can actually pronounce everything in it. Thanks so much for sharing!
14. Laura Etheridge — July 17, 2020 @ 8:20 pm Reply
Ali you are an absolute genius ! I keep finding more uses for this blend. 
It’s so much better that the store bought stuff. It goes wonderfully in a slaw, mixed with scrambled eggs, sprinkled on ricotta on toast, and on and on. 
Thanks for taking the time to figure this out ❤️❤️
15. Denise — August 15, 2020 @ 2:05 pm Reply
This is awesome stuff. I use it for lots of recipes. Dip. Dressing, taco soup. As a rub for chicken. Yummy
16. Stacy C — September 8, 2020 @ 2:39 pm Reply
How can I make this into a dip for raw veggies?
17. OW — December 10, 2020 @ 8:08 pm Reply
Absolutely the best, and so versatile! Can mix with just sour cream for dip, mix sour cream, Mayo and milk for salad dressing, or just use the flavorful powder to add to soups, meats, etc. I pulse it all with a Nutri Bullet…easy peazy. Sky’s the limit! Just DO IT! You have all the spices already, so why waste money on crappy ranch dressing? Thanks! This is a KEEPER secret!

How much do you use if Not using the buttermilk powder?
19. Sheepdoc — January 23, 2021 @ 5:29 pm Reply
Great DIY ranch mix with no scary chemicals. 3 T = 1 pkg
20. Charlaine — January 27, 2021 @ 10:55 am Reply
Ned to make and use this today but how much mix do you use if you do Not use the buttermilk powder?
21. Crystal H — April 7, 2021 @ 4:42 pm Reply
I used vegan Mayo and almond milk yogurt with a wee bit of almond milk. It’s a very good dairy free ranch.
22. Joseph Schlewitz — August 28, 2021 @ 5:17 pm Reply
Can I use coconut milk powder to make it vegan?
23. Sarah — October 6, 2021 @ 6:05 pm Reply
I have made dozens of homemade ranch recipes and this one was the best! I added some extra salt to taste and can’t wait to make it again! Your recipes are awesome!

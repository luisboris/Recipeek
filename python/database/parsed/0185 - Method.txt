Instructions
Season fish with salt, ground cumin and Tajin. 
Combine the ingredients for the sauce in a small bowl and refrigerate until ready to eat.
Toss the slaw ingredients and keep cold.
Place on preheated skillet and spray with olive oil, cook 4 to 5 minutes on each side until fish is just opaque and charred. Break up in large chunks.
Char the tortillas over an open flame on the burner or in a skillet about 30 seconds on each side, stack on a plate covered with a towel to keep warm.
Assemble tacos. Place slaw on the bottom of each tortilla, top with fish and drizzle with sauce, serve with lime wedges.

_Aloo gobi_ (आलू गोभी), also known as alu gobi, or aloo gobhi, is a vegetarian
dish from the Indian subcontinent based on potatoes (aloo), cauliflower (gobi)
and spices, very popular in Indian and Pakistani cuisine.
What is aloo gobi?
In Hindi, _aloo_ means potato and _gobi_ means cauliflower. Aloo gobi is
therefore made of potatoes and cauliflower with spices.
It is a yellowish colored dish, due to the use of turmeric. It traditionally
contains leaves and seeds of _kalonji_ (black cumin), curry leaves and _kasuri
methi_ (dried fenugreek leaves).

Other common ingredients in aloo gobi include cumin seeds, onion, garlic,
tomato, fresh coriander and coriander seeds, chili pepper, lime juice and
garam masala.
What is garam masala?
Although it is consumed in the West and defined around the world as a typical
Indian spice, curry has another definition in India. It is indeed a stew of
vegetables, meat or fish.
It is believed that what is called curry is actually a version of masala, a
mixture of spices, herbs and aromatics that can be made up of up to thirty
different ingredients. Although it is prepared in different ways in each
region, masala is an essential part of the identity of Indian cuisine.
Some examples of ingredients used are aniseed, cardamom, black pepper,
cinnamon, cloves, nutmeg, garlic and ginger.
There are several commercial, international, national, regional and even
homemade styles, family recipes of garam masala, some milder, some spicier,
some described more for their color, some more for their aroma.

Vegetarian cuisine in India
For a vegetarian, it is very easy to approach Indian cuisine because for
centuries it has offered a wide range of vegetarian dishes, as more than 32%
of the Indian population is vegetarian.
Cereal dishes, legumes (they use more than 50 varieties), fruits, vegetables,
spices, oil seeds, sesame, chutneys are an integral part of this cuisine.
India is home to one of the oldest cultures in the world with elements from
different regions and peoples. The melting pot that characterizes it makes it
one of the richest kitchens in the world.
Home to more than a billion people, India has a cuisine influenced by
different periods of its history, from the religious practices of antiquity to
British colonization.
Vegetarianism, extremely present in the country’s daily gastronomic life, has
its origins more than 2000 years ago in the Sramana movement and in the non-
aggressive vegetarian practices of Jainism and Buddhism.
With a wide variety of cereals, vegetables, delicacies and spices available,
Indian vegetarian cuisine is so diverse that it would be impossible to
summarize it in a single set of dishes.
In fact, it could even be said that talking about a single Indian cuisine is
not an easy thing to do, as each state and region has different tastes,
methods of preparation and preferences in the use of ingredients.
In Indian vegetarian cuisine, there is obviously no shortage of fruits and
vegetables. In India, there are many varieties of plants of very different
origins.
The Indian agricultural tradition is really very old: the development of
agriculture in the Indus Valley dates back to 7000 years before Christ; such a
deeply rooted tradition could only produce an immense wealth of plant
products.
It is very common to use mango in cooking, which is eaten both ripe and green;
with the addition of salt and sometimes chili pepper, or even dried and
ground, and then used as an ingredient to flavor dishes with spices.
Another common ingredient, also in the preparation of Indian desserts, is
coconut.
In India, spices are widely used in vegetarian cuisine to give a lot of flavor
to vegetables, legumes, cereals and even desserts.
The most common are cardamom, coriander, cloves, nutmeg, cumin, pepper,
fenugreek, chilli, paprika, ginger, tamarind, turmeric, and mustard.
Among condiments, the most common ingredient is certainly ghee, the
characteristic Indian clarified butter. However, for those who have decided to
exclude milk and derivatives from their diet, the supply of condiments in
Indian cuisine is quite extensive.
In fact, in the vegetarian recipes of Indian cuisine, sunflower and soybean
oil, coconut butter, vegetable margarine and mustard seed oil are often used.
Finally, there are herbal condiments and also chutneys, made with fruits and
vegetables without the addition of milk or milk derivatives, therefore perfect
not only for vegetarian cooking but also for those who follow a vegan diet.
They are composed of vegetables or fruits such as mangoes, tomatoes, onions,
limes, peaches and dates, with the addition of spices, especially chili pepper
to make them spicy.
Here are some vegetarian dishes and meals from this great gastronomic culture
that is India:
_Aloo masala_ , based on potatoes and spicy onion confit.
_Onion bhajji_, fritters made from thinly sliced onions and chickpea
flour.
_Dhal makhani_ is made of black lentils, red beans, tomato puree, spices
and clarified butter (ghee).
_Samosa_ is made of a fried dough, traditionally garnished with a
selection of vegetables (peas, potatoes, carrots and lots of spices).
There are several versions, but the vegetable stuffing is by far the
winner.
_Idiyappam_ , a Sri Lankan and Indian specialty prepared with rice (or
millet) flour that is pressed in a machine to form fine noodles. The
noodles are then steamed before being served, traditionally with coconut
sambol (pol sambol) or kiri hodi. In the Indian subcontinent, idiyappam is
also known as _indi appa, semige, semé da addae, shavige, noolappam,
nooputt, noolputtu, irmandappa, putumayam_ or _string hoppers_ in English.
_Paneer,_ a traditional Indian and Pakistani cheese, resembling cottage
cheese and ricotta, usually cut into cubes to be eaten as is or cooked in
sauce or roasted in a tandoor (paneer tikka).
_Palak paneer_, prepared by cooking the paneer cubes in a spinach sauce
(palak) with spices, cream and pepper.
Chapati, _roti_ , _paratha_ , and _naan_ : Bread in India is a serious
thing. There are a variety of methods to make flat breads, which are
flattened and baked in a tandoor or made on _tawa_ (iron plate). Most of
them are unleavened.
How to eliminate the cauliflower smell during cooking?
Cauliflower is one of the healthiest vegetables available. Not only does it
contain vitamin C, vitamin K, vitamin B6 and folic acid, but it also contains
fiber, potassium, manganese, phosphorus and magnesium.
Eating it is undoubtedly beneficial for the body, but many people give up
cooking it because of the smell it gives off during cooking. Indeed, this
vegetable has an intense and sometimes annoying smell that spreads quickly
throughout the house.
There are remedies to avoid this unpleasant passage. These are very simple
home remedies used by grandmothers who, certainly from their experience, knew
how to solve the problem using the little they had at their disposal :
A slice of bread on the lid: the first trick is to place a slice of bread
or bread rich in crumb on the valve of the pressure cooker in which the
cauliflower is cooking. The steam that escapes will be absorbed by the
bread and will not spread in the kitchen and the rest of the house.
Lemon: half a lemon cut into small wedges immersed in the cooking water
and left to cook for the entire cooking time. Lemon neutralizes strong
smells like cauliflower, so it is a simple remedy with guaranteed results.
A few pieces of celery: take a few pieces of celery and plunge them into
the cauliflower cooking water.
A slice of bread in the pot: simultaneously, a slice of bread can also be
placed inside the pot with the cauliflower. Before being added to water,
however, it must first be soaked in lemon juice or white vinegar.
A potato in the cooking water: if you do not wish to use a slice of bread
soaked in lemon or vinegar because of their too intense aromas, which
could alter the flavor of the cauliflower, add a raw potato to the cooking
water after carefully peeling it.
One or more bay leaves: another tip is to plunge a few bay leaves into the
cauliflower cooking water.
A glass of milk in water: to absorb the smell of cauliflower and prevent
it from blackening, a small glass of milk can be added to the cooking
water.
A glass of vinegar on the lid of the kettle
A glass full of vinegar can be placed on the lid of the kettle or pressure
cooker, near the discharge valve.
Capers in the cauliflower pot: another option is to place a spoonful of
capers in the cauliflower pot. The capers, in contact with the cooking
water of the vegetable, will eliminate the smell, preventing it from being
released. It should be noted that the addition of capers, also having a
strong taste, will not alter the flavor of the cauliflower, which will
remain tasty.
Thanks to these few grandmother’s remedies, the bad smells will be driven
away, not only from the cauliflower used in the aloo gobi, but also other
types of cooked vegetables that generate the same problem, such as broccoli,
onion, turnip, and so on.

Instructions
Heat 5 tablespoons of oil in a skillet over medium to high heat.
When the oil is hot, add the cumin and nigella seeds and cook for a few seconds until they pop, then add the potatoes and sauté until golden brown.
Remove the potatoes from the skillet using a skimmer and place them in a bowl.
Repeat the same operation with the cauliflower, and transfer them to a separate bowl.
Lower the heat to low to medium, add the remaining 2 tablespoons of oil, and the onion and sauté until tender and golden (but not brown), then stir in the garlic and ginger and sauté while stirring for a few minutes.
Add the tomatoes, ground coriander, chili and turmeric and cook, stirring regularly, until the oil begins to surface on the sides of the skillet.
Add the potatoes and green hot peppers. Season with salt. Bring to a boil, lower the heat, cover and cook for 5 minutes.
Add the cauliflower and water, mix, cover and cook until the cauliflower and potatoes are tender, gently stirring occasionally, to make sure they don't stick by adding more water gradually, if necessary.
Remove from the heat, stir in the kasuri methi and garam masala and let stand 10 minutes, then stir in the lime juice and cilantro before serving.
Serve with rice, naan or paratha bread.

At Alto, Michael White uses dandelion greens to give his slightly spicy sausage pasta a bitter edge, but chicory or escarole makes a great stand-in. More Great Pastas

Ingredients
Ingredient Checklist
1 pound orecchiette 
1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil 
1 pound sweet Italian sausage, casings removed 
2 garlic cloves, thinly sliced 
1/2 teaspoon crushed red pepper 
1 pound chicory or escarole, coarsely chopped and washed 
Kosher salt 
1 cup chicken stock or low-sodium broth 
1/4 cup grated pecorino, plus more for serving 
2 tablespoons shredded mint 
Directions
Instructions Checklist
Step 1
In a large pot of boiling salted water, cook the pasta until al dente. Drain well.

Step 2
Meanwhile, in a large, deep skillet, heat 2 tablespoons of the olive oil until shimmering. Add the sausage and cook over moderately high heat, breaking it up with a wooden spoon, until browned, about 7 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the sausage to a plate.
Step 3
Add the garlic, crushed red pepper and the remaining 2 tablespoons of olive oil to the skillet and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add the chicory with any water clinging to the leaves and season with salt. Cover and cook until wilted, about 2 minutes. Uncover and cook until the chicory is tender and the liquid has evaporated, about 5 minutes longer.
Step 4
Add the pasta to the skillet along with the sausage, chicken stock and pecorino and cook over moderate heat, stirring constantly, until the liquid is slightly reduced and creamy, about 3 minutes. Stir in the mint and serve right away, passing extra cheese at the table.
Suggested Pairing 
Spicy, cherry-full Dolcetto d'Alba.

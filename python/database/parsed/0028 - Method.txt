Polenta:
Bring coconut milk and vegetable broth to a boil in a pot. Stir in polenta by using a whisk.
Reduce heat to a low simmer and continue to whisk for 1-2 minutes to avoid lumps.
Then cover and let simmer for about 10 minutes (or according packaging instructions), stirring occasionally. (If the polenta thickens too much you can add additional milk and/or water and stir to thin.)
Once the Polenta is creamy and smooth, remove from the stovetop. Add nutritional yeast or vegan parmesan and stir (optional).
Mushroom Spinach Topping:
Heat oil in a skillet or pan. Add mushrooms along with onions and fry for about 3 minutes on high heat or until beginning to get golden-brown.
Add minced garlic and roast for 30 seconds longer. Then add soy sauce and spinach and cook for 1-2 minutes or until spinach is wilted. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Add a splash of fresh lime juice, if you like.
Toast pine nuts in a small pan without oil until lightly browned.
Serve polenta with mushrooms, spinach and pine nuts.
Enjoy!

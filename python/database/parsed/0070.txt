Recipe Description
Johor royal family member shares signature cempedak kek lapis. Born in Johor, Balkis and her family are members of the Johor royal family who moved to the Klang Valley in the 1970s. But their passion for heritage Johor food has never wavered, inspired at least in part by the indomitable Esah’s talent for cooking these meals.
For Balkis’ family, Hari Raya simply wouldn’t be complete without her kek lapis (layer cake), something that deviates from Johor food but that she learnt how to make herself as her family has such a proclivity for sweet treats.
Originally thought to be from Indonesia, kek lapis has acquired new life in Sarawak, where talented bakers have transformed the basic cake into thrilling creations featuring geometric patterns in all kinds of hues.
Making even the simplest version of the cake (striped layers) requires determination, as the constant layering during the baking process (every five minutes or so) can be quite exhausting.
Although Balkis sticks to simple striped layers for her kek lapis, her flavour range is where she really experiments, with kek lapis variants that include chocolate, Nutella and even durian! But it is perhaps her cempedak kek lapis (jackfruit layer cake) that is truly outstanding – a lightly sweet affair that features buttery, dense cake with the distinct flavours of jackfruit running riot throughout.
For my kek lapis, I only use good quality butter and a lot of eggs to get the consistency right. And for the jackfruit filling, I make it from scratch using fresh jackfruit, ” she says with pride.

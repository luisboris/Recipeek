Instructions
1. Mix the biga, flour, water, salt and yeast together to form a dough.
2. Let it sit for 1 hour covered with cling film.
3. Preheat the oven to 220C. Divide the dough into two pieces. Roll out the two pieces to similar sized circles, about 26 cm in diameter.
4. Place the salami evenly around one of the pieces of dough, leaving a 2 cm border.
5. Cover with the prosciutto and mozzarella.
6. Top with the pecorino and pour the egg over (or place sliced hard boiled egg).
7. Top with the other piece of dough and roll the edges together to seal.
8. Cut a hole in the middle of the dough to allow the steam to escape. Place on a baking pan covered with parchment paper or a hot baking stone. Bake for 20 to 25 minutes or until golden.

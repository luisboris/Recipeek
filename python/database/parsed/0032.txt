This moist and sticky polenta cake isn't just full of sweet orange and rich almonds; it's also completely vegan. It makes the most of the vegan wonder-ingredient aquafaba (the water from a can of chickpeas), which is whisked into a stiff meringue to add body and lightness to both the cake itself and the coconut yoghurt crème.

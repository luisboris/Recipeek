Escoffier recipe for making Bread Panada for les farces de poisson, fish forcemeats (Escoffier, 281).
Used as a base to thicken firm-textured fish forcemeats, farces de poisson in French cooking, this simple mixture of bread and milk is called a panada , (not to be confused with the Italian bread soup of the same name). There are five types of panada described by Escoffier, each suitable for thickening different types of forcemeats: bread panada, flour panada, Frangipane panada, rice panada and potato panada. They are generally used in a 1:2 ratio with the ingredient they are thickening, sometimes with eggs and butter added.
Bread Panada
In a small saucepan, bring the milk to a simmer over medium heat. Remove their crusts and then cube the bread slices. 
Soak the cubed bread in boiled milk until very soft.
Process the soaked bread in a food processor to form a smooth paste. 
Store the bread panada in a covered plastic container in the refrigerator.

305g Strauss Family Creamery whole milk

Salter digital scale

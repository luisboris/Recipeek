This healthy buckwheat soup is packed with tender, fall-off-the bone meat and is as filling as it is comforting. Makes for amazing leftovers!_
As a Ukrainian, I was practically born to love soup. My mother had many different recipes in her rotation that kept me and my siblings full and healthy. Looking back, buckwheat was a primary ingredient she tapped into to keep up satiated longer. This healthy buckwheat soup comes directly from her cookbook and I can’t wait to share it with you and your family! 
Made with bone-in beef or pork, hearty buckwheat, and veggies, this delicious soup eats like a meal in and of itself. On those nights when you don’t want to fuss with several courses or side dishes, it’s the perfect one-pot meal to lean on. 
If you’re just starting to experiment with the wonders of buckwheat, try your hand at making a couple of our other tried and true recipes – stewed buckwheat with beef, buckwheat meat patties, and buckwheat with mushrooms. 
How to Make Buckwheat Soup
All you need to make buckwheat soup is a big pot of water, a handful of simple ingredients, and a couple of quick and easy steps. Below, find a quick hitter overview of the recipe before you dive in. 
Boil the Meat: Place a whole piece of bone-in beef or pork in a large soup pot or Dutch oven filled with water. Bring it to a boil, turn the heat down to medium, and add the bay leaves. Cook for 40 minutes and season with salt. 
Add the Buckwheat : Next, add the buckwheat groats and cook for another 15 minutes. 
Add the Potatoes: Clean and dice the potatoes and add them into the soup pot. 
Sauté the Onions and Carrots : In a skillet with oil, sauté the diced carrots and onions and add them to the soup. Cook for an additional 5 minutes.
Add the Herbs: Slice the fresh dill or parsley and add the herbs to the soup. Remove from heat and serve! 
Tips for Making the Best Buckwheat Soup
Below, find some tips and tricks to help you make the best soup. 
Use a bone-in cut and cook it whole. Bone-in cuts lend so much rich marrow and gelatin to soup broth. You won’t regret the added depth of flavor! In addition, there’s no need to slice bone-in cuts before adding them to the soup pot. They will naturally break apart on their own during the cooking process. 
Cook the soup in a Dutch oven. If you have a Dutch oven, use it! The heavy lid and steaming effects make meat ultra-tender and flavorful. 
Top the soup with fresh herbs versus dried. Fresh dill or parsley elevates the flavor of this savory soup like no other. Dried herbs just don’t compare. 
Serving Buckwheat Soup
Buckwheat soup is filling enough to be eaten as a meal all on its own. For a more well-rounded meal, pair it with a slice of buttered honey wheat bread or baguette to sop up all the tasty broth. You can also whip up a caesar salad or beet garlic salad for that classic soup and salad combo. 
Storing Buckwheat Soup
Refrigerator: Store leftover buckwheat soup in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to a week. As it marinates in itself in the fridge, it will get more and more flavor making for awesome leftovers. 
Freezer: Freeze leftover soup by first letting it cool down completely. Next, transfer it to a freezer-safe bag or airtight container and store it in the freezer for up to 3 months. To thaw, place soup in the fridge for a couple of hours.
Reheating Tip : Reheat leftover soup by placing it in a saucepan over medium heat until warmed through. 
FAQ
What is the best cut of meat to use for buckwheat soup? 
The best cut of meat for buckwheat soup is beef oxtail. It contains the most gelatin and marrow, adding a wonderful depth of flavor to the broth. Alternately, you could use bone-in short ribs or cross-cut shanks. 
Should I slice the meat into cubes or place the cut in whole? 
There’s no need to slice the meat into cubes if you’re using a bone-in cut. As the slow slow cooks, the meat will naturally break apart as it tenderizes. 
Should I rinse the buckwheat before adding it to the soup? 
Yes, you should rinse the buckwheat before adding it to the soup to remove any excess starch or debris. 
Can I use pearl barley instead of buckwheat? 
Yes, you can use pearly barley instead of buckwheat. Toss it in at the same time you would the buckwheat to make sure it’s tender and has enough time to add a nice, nutty flavor to the soup. 
Can I use chicken instead of beef or pork? 
Yes, you can use chicken instead of pork. If possible, opt for more flavor dark meat cuts such as thighs and breasts. Avoid using chicken breasts, as they will turn dry and tough during slow cooking.

I sought this recipe to try and recreate a meal served during my trip to Lake Baikal. I made this with quinoa instead of buckwheat (couldn't find it at the store), and paired it with a roll. Absolutely AMAZING! This is definitely a comforting and hearty dish. My only recommendation is to add more pork than you originally planned. The bone-in means less meat, and it was a shame to only have such a small portion. I also added a few more potatoes because "too many potatoes" is not in my cooking vocabulary 😉 
10/10 would recommend.

Emily, so happy to hear you loved it. I do think quinoa is a great replacement. If you spot any European market in your area, they should have buckwheat.

Buckwheat in WF is a little different. It gets ready too fast and doesn’t hold the shape. You may want to dry it out before, maybe in over or fry it a little

I don't think I've ever had a soup with buckwheat but I love it and will have to make a soup with it soon. I put soup on my menu once a week but have been thinking about making it more often, soup is so easy and there are so many different options! And with our WA weather, I think we might as well take advantage of soup season 😉 Thanks for the recipe

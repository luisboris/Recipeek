What is Banh mi?
Classicly Banh mi is made in the form of a sandwich. It is popular street food in Vietnam and one of the best fusion cuisines I know. A blend of Vietnamese and French foods, a Banh mi sandwich combines Vietnamese meats and vegetables with the French baguette and wonderful creamy condiments for a sandwich that will amaze you.
For our Banh mi pizza, all we need to do is swap out our French baguette for an artisan pizza crust and we have a Vietnamese/Italian/French fusion meal that is so so good!
Recommended Ingredients & Equipment
A blend of Vietnamese and French foods, this pizza combines Vietnamese meats and vegetables with the artisan pizza crust and its wonderful creamy condiments for a meal that will amaze you.
Here is everything you'll need.
Ingredients & Substitutions
Extra Firm Tofu â€“ Look for _extra-firm_ tofu that is not water-packed, such as Trader Joeâ€™s High-Protein Tofu or Super Firm Sprouted Tofu. These types of tofu do not have excess water and do not need to be pressed. If you have to use water-packed tofu make sure to press as much water as you can out of it first by using a tofu pressor a weighted, towel-lined cutting board.
Marinade â€“ This is a combination of soy sauce, rice vinegar, maple syrup, sesame oil, and fresh ginger.
Oil â€“ Any high-heat oil will do like coconut or avocado.
Vegan Mayonnaise â€“ My favorite brand is Just Mayo. It is shelf-stable and has a similar price point to non-vegan mayonnaise. However, any vegan mayo will do.
Hoisin Sauce
Sriracha
Agave Nectar
Quick Pickled Veggies â€“ A combination of carrots, cucumbers, jalapeÃ±os, granulated sugar, rice vinegar, and salt.
Pizza Dough \- I typically buy pre-made pizza dough which can be found in the refrigerated section of most well-stocked grocery stores. When baked, it tastes as fresh as if made in your kitchen while eliminating a time-consuming step in homemade pizza. However, feel free to make pizza dough from scratch or buy par-baked pizza dough.
Cilantro
JalapeÃ±o
Recommended Equipment
For this recipe you will need a large, shallow dish for marinating the tofu, a large skillet, a chefâ€™s knife, cutting board, a pizza stone and pizza cutter and basic kitchen utensils. _( <<affiliate links)_

How to Make Vegan Banh mi Pizza
Step One â€“ Prepare the Tofu
The first step is swapping out the Vietnamese meat for marinated tofu.
I used extra firm tofu that is pressed and marinated in a mixture of soy sauce, sesame oil, hoisin sauce, and rice vinegar for a classic Vietnamese taste. Let the flavors soak into the tofu for at least an hour.
Cut tofu into Â¼â€³ slices and pan-fried it in hot oil for that chewy, crispy texture.
Step Two â€“ Quick Pickled Vegetables
Thinly slice the carrots, cucumbers, and jalapeÃ±os. Whisk them together with the rice vinegar, sugar, and salt. Cover and refrigerate until ready to use.
For this recipe, I omitted the daikon because they can be difficult to find and I like to keep my recipes as simple as possible. However, if you can find daikon at your local grocery store, feel free to add that in with the carrots and the cucumber for a more authentic vegetable mix.
Step Three â€“ Creamy Banh Mi Sauce
Lastly, make the creamy Banh mi sauce.
The Bahn mi fusion brings together Vietnamese flavors with French condiments. A combination of vegan mayonnaise, soy sauce, hoisin sauce, and Sriracha (or jalapeÃ±os) are whipped up into a spicy, tangy, creamy, and oh-so-delicious sauce that will have you licking your fingers for more.
Step Four - Assemble the Pizza
For the recipe, the crust gets baked separately. Stretch out the crust and bake it in a hot oven for about 15 minutes, until the edges are lightly brown. Once the crust is out of the oven, slather it in Banh mi sauce and top it with quick-pickled vegetables, sautÃ©ed tofu, jalapeÃ±os, and cilantro.
Serve immediately.
Serving And Storing
Serve pizza fresh out of the oven.
Store leftover pizza in an airtight container in the refrigerator 1-2 days. Gently reheat the pizza in the oven or on the stovetop before eating.

What an amazing blend of flavors! Perfect for our "specialty pizza Saturdays". I made sure to cut my tofu extra-thin and it crisped up so well in the pan. It was a delicious contrast to the cool pickled veggies. I threw some radishes in the mix too. Thank you !

I love pizza, but maybe not quite as much as my hubby who would marry pizza if he could. This combo of flavors sure sounds delicious and I know it would be a big hit in our household. Yay for finding awesome new recipes to try!

Those brown pieces like bacon is the tofu? What's 
agave and sriracha? Do we have it here in Japan?

Yes, that's tofu. I'm not sure if you have agave or sriracha in Japan. Agave is a sweetener. You could sub maple syrup and Sriracha is a hot sauce.

Sarah, I am all about this pizza!! I want it soon, it looks and sounds so awesome. Next time we make pizza, we will make this (however, we have been enjoying nice meals made for us for the last week since William was born so we're having a nice holiday from cooking). 
Thank you ðŸ™‚

I'm happy you restocked your pantry and are in the process of making an awesome meal plan! I know how easy it is to succumb to cereal dinners - I sometimes feel like I could eat oatmeal for breakfast, lunch, and dinner and be quite content ðŸ˜€ 
I might add, this pizza looks like summer! It is gorgeous!!! Pinned!

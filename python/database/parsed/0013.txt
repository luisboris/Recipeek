I have tried and tasted so many hobnob recipes and have never been satisfied with the results, so I decided it was time to recreate my own. I have experimented so many times, changing ingredients/method, never giving up. I hope you enjoy these as much as I do.

Ingredients
75g butter or margarine
75g Caster Sugar 
1/2 tbsp Golden Syrup
75g Wholemeal Flour 
150g Oats
1/2 tsp Bicarbonate of Soda 
Method
STEP 1
Preheat the oven to 180°C/160°C fan. Line two large baking sheets with parchment paper.
STEP 2
Beat together the butter and sugar until light and fluffy. Add syrup and mix well.
STEP 3
Combine the flour, oats and bicarbonate of soda in a separate bowl. Add to the wet mixture a bit at a time, ensuring you mix well to incorporate all the ingredients together. It should be crumbly at this stage.
STEP 4
Place a 6.5cm cookie cutter onto one of the baking sheets, using a desert spoon, place a spoonful of the mixture into the cookie cutter and compress down as much as you can. Repeat until mixture is all used up.
STEP 5
Bake in the oven for10 minutes or until golden brown. Allow to cool completely on the baking sheets.

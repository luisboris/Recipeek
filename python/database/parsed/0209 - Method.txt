Instructions
1. Add olive oil to a large pot or dutch oven and place over medium high heat. Add in diced onion, celery, sliced carrots and potatoes. Saute for 3-5 minutes or until onions soften.
2. Next add in crushed tomatoes, kidney beans, vegetable broth, Italian seasoning, red pepper flakes and salt and pepper. Cover and cook on medium low for 10-15 minutes.
3. Next stir in the green beans, spinach and pasta. Cook uncovered for 8-12 more minutes or until pasta is al dente and green beans are tender. Pour into a bowl and serve with parmesan cheese on top. I also like to serve mine with garlic bread, crostinis or crackers. Personally I think soup makes amazing leftovers and is even more delicious the next day.
Recipe Notes
To make vegan: simply leave the cheese off the top or use your favorite vegan parmesan.
To add more heartiness and protein with meat: saute 1 pound ground turkey or beef with the onions and carrots until meat is nice and browned. Continue the recipe as written.
Make it in your slow cooker:
1. Add all of your ingredients besides the spinach and noodles to your slow cooker.
2. Cook this on high for 3-4 hours or on low for 6-7 hours until the carrots and potatoes are fork-tender.
3. In the last 10 minutes of cooking add the noodles and spinach and leave soup uncovered until noodles are al dente.
If you'd like you can sub 1 cup diced zucchini or corn in place of the green beans, or skip the greens beans all together.
To freeze: I'd recommend freezing this soup without the added noodles, as they can become mushy while reheating. Let the soup completely cool, transfer it to a freezer-safe container, and store it in the fridge for up to 2 months.
To reheat: first let the soup thaw in the refrigerator. While it's thawing you can make the 4oz of pasta on the stovetop. Heat the soup in the microwave or on the stovetop, and then add the cooked noodles.

Instructions
preparation
First soak 1 heaped cup rice in water for 30 minutes. Use any regular rice. I used sona masuri rice.
Then pressure cook the rice with 2 cups water, ¼ teaspoon salt for 3 to 4 whistles on a medium flame or for 11 to 12 minutes. You can also cook the rice in a pot. If cooking in a pot, then you may need to add more water.
Soak ½ tablespoon tightly packed tamarind in ¼ cup hot water for 20 to 30 minutes.
Later squeeze the soaked tamarind in the water to get the tamarind pulp. Strain and keep aside.
When the pressure settles down on its own, open the cooker's lid and fluff the rice. 
You can allow the rice to cool in the cooker itself or spread rice on a large plate/thali or tray. Allow the cooked rice grains to become warm or cool down. Cover and keep so that the rice grains do not dry out.
When the rice is cooking, rinse the brinjals. Remove the crowns of the brinjals and slice them vertically in 4 long pieces. As soon as you chop them, place them in a bowl containing water to which some salt has been added. 
Do make sure that there is sufficient water covering the brinjals. Allow them to be in the salted water for 15 to 20 minutes.
making vangi bath
Heat 2 tablespoons peanut oil (can also use sesame oil or sunflower oil) in a pan or kadai.
Add ½ teaspoon mustard seeds.
Once the mustard seeds begin to crackle, then add ½ teaspoon urad dal.
Next add 2 tablespoons roasted peanuts or cashews.
Saute till the urad dal becomes golden.
Then add 1 to 2 dry red chilies, 1 sprig curry leaves or 10 to 12 curry leaves and ⅛ teaspoon asafoetida (about 2 pinches of asafoetida).
Add the brinjals. Just remove the brinjals from the salted water and add in the pan. Be careful as the mixture splutters when adding brinjals.
Mix them with the rest of the tempering mixture.
Add ¼ teaspoon turmeric powder. Also add salt as per taste.
Mix the turmeric powder and salt very well.
Cover the pan with a lid and let the brinjals get half-cooked. Do check at intervals. While cooking, if the brinjals start sticking to the pan then add some water. Then cover and cook.
Half cook the brinjals.
Once they are half done, then add the tamarind pulp.
Then add 2 to 2.5 tablespoons vangi bath masala powder.
Mix very well and continue to cook without the lid. If the masala along with brinjals start sticking to pan, then add ¼ cup water and continue to cook.
Once the brinjals are cooked well, add 2 tablespoons grated coconut and ¼ to ½ teaspoon jaggery powder.
Mix again very well. The brinjal masala is thick. But for some moisture you can have a semi gravy consistency in the brinjal masala.
Keep the pan down and add rice in two to three parts. Mix gently.
Add the next portion of rice and then mix well.
Mix gently but very well so that everything is mixed evenly.
Serve vangi bath with raita, papads or chips.

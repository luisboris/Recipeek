This easy, healthy cod fish taco recipe is seasoned with a chili-lime cumin rub topped with slaw and creamy lime sauce – no breading, no frying!
Cod Fish Tacos
These fish tacos have a delicious crisp cabbage and carrot slaw, then drizzled with a lightened up chili-lime sauce. SO good! Me and Karina, my oldest daughter love fish, but my husband Tommy does not… unless I make fish tacos! These healthy fish tacos are my favorite way to get him to eat fish and they are so quick, ready in 30 minutes. For a fun spin on fish tacos, try these Greek Fish Tacos, Scallop Tacos or these Lobster Tacos.
For the delicious, creamy sauce, I combined some Greek yogurt with lime juice, a little mayo and Tajin (affil link), my favorite chili-lime seasoning and a must to add to your spice rack (Trader Joes also has a version of this). The fish is also seasoned with Tajin and cumin, so good! Use a little water to loosen it to make it easy to drizzle.
Best fish for fish tacos:
Here I used wild cod fish fillets, but any flaky white fish can be used here. Try snapper or mahi mahi fillets.
How to cook cod for fish tacos
Since there’s no breading, I find the fastest and easiest way to cook the cod for fish tacos is in a skillet so you get a little char. You can broil them if you prefer, or cook them on the grill on foil in the summer.

Loved this dinner. I didn’t have Tajin, but did have Sazon and didn’t have cabbage but substituted iceberg & spinach. I ate this as a taco bowl rather than tacos so I could save 3 WW points by skippng the corn tortillas. My husband & I are doing our part to eat healthy, so thank you Gina helping us with your great recipes!

I also dislike cilantro. A trick to get the non-soapy version of the flavor is to mixed flat leaf parsley with lime juice…it works really well!

This recipe was so delicious and tasted so much better than restaurant fish tacos I’ve had. I didn’t have the chili lime spice, but easily made it myself. This is a super winner. I’ll be making this again and again!

This was Great! Made my own tagine seasoning .I happened to have Mexican dry chillier plus chilli Padilla’s as well as chilies Arbol slice ih half and take out the seeds. 
Than I added 1 1’tsp of garlic powder and 1 tsp of onion powder powder plus 1 Lime zest and 1 tsp of cumin .than I grind I it in a spice grinder till it turned to powder put in a jar for future use.
Fish tacos were delicious ! I used corvina fish it was delish!

THESE ARE TO DIE FOR!! 
My dad was skeptical at first because it was from a site with “skinny” in it. But this is the second time in a month that we made this. My dad and brother who aren’t dieting also love it!! These are the best fish taco’s ever 
Didn’t have Tajin tho so I just used salt, pepper, paprika and chili powder. 
Also swapped Greek yoghurt for normal no sugar yoghurt and just used less water.

WHY does everything have to have soapy cilantro?? Parsley is a bad substitute. Other ideas for more flavor? I find all these recipes that look good and, voila, cilantro comes along and ruins them.
Jae — March 31, 2021 @ 3:42 pm Reply
If you don’t like cilantro, don’t add it. Tacos are a MEXICAN dish. Cilantro is used heavily in MEXICAN dishes as well as some other cultures in the world. For MOST people cilantro is delicious and adds a unique flavor to dishes. If you are one of the people who hate it then don’t use it! 
Paula Connolly — May 15, 2021 @ 10:47 am 
Blame my Olfactory Receptor 6A2. Luckily, there are a lot of Mexican dishes that are flavored well without cilantro. My question was about how to flavor it up without using cilantro.
VegasB — May 20, 2021 @ 11:00 pm 
MOST people? MEXICAN? Lmao 
GREAT recipe. All Mexicans don’t like cilantro. True story.
Danielle — April 22, 2021 @ 8:46 am Reply
You can substitute flat Italian parsley for cilantro… it’s mild enough that it won’t change the overall flavor of the dish. 
Paula Connolly — May 15, 2021 @ 10:47 am 
Thanks
tina — August 11, 2021 @ 6:33 am Reply
Or is it to much cilantro, I’m not a fan when to much cilantro is used alot. A little goes a long way in recipes or not using it at all works, why use any substitute? Enjoy your tacos, the way you like.
rebekah — September 29, 2021 @ 4:16 pm Reply
You only think cilantro tastes soapy because you have a specific gene mutation that makes it taste like soap. It ONLY tastes soapy to people who have this gene mutation. So, not everyone finds cilantro to taste soapy 😉 if you dont like cilantro becuase of your gene mutation, don’t look for taco dishes.
Chum — December 17, 2021 @ 11:23 am 
People say all the time that the gene mutation causes the reaction. Maybe so, but I wonder if folks can just acclimate themselves to the taste? I used to think it tasted soapy, then I started eating it more because of necessity on travel and the soapiness is gone for me. It’s become my favorite herb to use now.
Chum — December 17, 2021 @ 11:27 am Reply
You could use whatever herbs you like or skip it altogether. Cooking is like religion. Take what you want from a recipe and make it fit your own life. Recipes are merely guidelines. Gina probably doesn’t make the same exact recipe twice. It’s harder when you are learning to cook, but I never make a recipe as written. I look at them for inspiration and then use my cupboard and my family’s tastes and my mood to alter recipes to fit my needs. Btw, when I didn’t eat cilantro (I love it now), I would add extra lime juice, raw onion, radishes, hot sauce, etc. to my tacos and didn’t miss the herbs.

Oh my! Fir the first time in 20 years in Australia came across Taijin seasoning. I was intrigued, bought it, scrolled through you website (love it.. plus have all your books thanks to Amazon… not available here)…. found this and had for dinner tonight! AMAZING!

I used Maui Maui and broiled it. So delicious! I love this recipe! I also used corn street tacos. Two loaded up with fish and sauce and slaw!
37. Michele — January 12, 2021 @ 10:09 am Reply
I made it with Tilapia because I had it on hand. Instead of slaw I used a chopped asian salad mix that is super crunchy (again on hand) and it had most of the slaw choices in it. I did add some red onion because I am extra. The sauce makes this dish. I love the Tajin seasoning and have been planning to buy and use for a while, so this recipe was the perfect excuse for doing that. I used crunchy taco shells because I sent my husband to the grocery store and that is what he came back with…..again still delish. We will be having this again soon. We have been trying to incorporate fish into our diets, for my husband that is easy but not so much for myself.
38. Rita F — January 9, 2021 @ 12:44 pm Reply
I forgot to get a picture, before finishing. Lol. These were so good and so easy to make. I made the slaw and sauce the night before and cooked the fish the night I made them. I didn’t use cod but instead used Halibut because that’s what I had. They were Amazing!! We ate it with brown cilantro rice. 
I took leftovers to work and I just put the fish over the rice. Added leftover slaw and sauces on top after heating it up.
Definitely recommended!!
39. Alexander McKenzie — January 4, 2021 @ 1:55 pm Reply
This is a fantastic recipe. The cumin and Tajin are perfect for the fish. I don’t think the extra salt is needed in the fish seasoning or the sauce. I make twice the amount of slaw, add a thin sliced shallot to it. I add some of the sauce to a small standalone serving of the slaw for a good side.
40. MollyS — December 7, 2020 @ 4:14 pm Reply
I was just looking through the site and I have everything for this meal in my house already (frozen cod, leftover cabbages, greek yogurt…) I don’t have to go to the store, BIG WIN! I’ll post after dinner how it goes 🙂

Loved these tacos. I used frozen fish sticks in the Air fryer but made the sauce and slaw as directed. Delicious!!!
42. Molly — October 7, 2020 @ 8:31 pm Reply
Fantastic! Definitely a keeper. I made this with mahi mahi. Also didn’t have tajin so I made it using a recipe from chilipeppermadness.com. If you (like me) aren’t a huge fan of the intense crunch of raw cabbage I recommend sweating it in 2:1 sugar salt mixture for 5 minutes, then rinsing and drying in a salad spinner. I love the charred tortillas, never thought to do that before!
43. Geri — October 7, 2020 @ 6:18 pm Reply
These are amazingly delicious! I made them with mahi mahi & Trader Joe’s chili lime seasoning. My kids all loved them and would not usually eat raw cabbage. They are so easy and quick we will definitely be making them regularly.

These were seriously fantastic. The slaw was to die for. I usually steer clear of fish unless it’s fried, but I loved this and found myself incredulously checking the calorie count in disbelief. A couple of things I had to do differently- I used all Greek yogurt in the sauce instead of mayo since I didn’t have it, and added a little sriracha. For seasoning, I used a generic chipotle seasoning I had on hand and squirted the fish with a little lime to make up for it. 
51. Mary Beth Tingley — August 11, 2020 @ 8:39 pm Reply
Great easy weeknight meal! I used fresh tailapia for the fish, which absorbed the flavors and was very flaky and tender. Weeknight hack: use a bag of preshredded coleslaw mix to cut down the prep time!

I would visit Ensenada often in the 70’s and 80’s and the cali-mex fusion of taco styles of today has been amazing, but I still think its all about the batter and I have a simple recipe that I received from a street vendor – They would use Angel fish, slice into strips, almost room temp, place strips into luke warm saltwater for 10 min (it cleans the fish). The batter, mix in a bowl Bisquick, Corona beer, mexican oregano, mustard, pepper. Place the fish in the batter and marinate for at least 2 hrs. Cabbage, salsa, guacamole and splash of lime.
67. DJ — May 10, 2020 @ 9:53 am Reply
Excellent!
We cooked the cod on the BBQ (Traeger – 12 min. on high), and I used a bag of cabbage slaw for the ease. Made the sauce and mixed the fish seasonings early in the day, so dinner was quick and delicious! 
I had mine with two small corn tortillas; and an additional small serving without a tortilla. Didn’t make enough for four of “our size” servings, though. There’s not much left over.

Just an explosion of flavors when you bite into it! I was surprised on how great this is, and easy to prepare. A double win. I followed the recipe to the letter, and I used white bass. 
I did make twice as much as the recipe called for to serve 4 adults. Everyone was full with a few left overs.

These are fantastic! I’ve made the crispy Greek fish tacos, but greatly prefer these. So much flavor! I accidentally made the slaw too salty, but read online to add some apple cider vinegar and it worked! I heat my tortillas in a toaster oven on the toast function. Once they start getting warm, I put the setting on keep warm and they turn out great! I did add a little garlic powder and paprika to the the fish, and lots of cumin, more than called for. This is a keeper!
71. Trish — April 26, 2020 @ 7:14 am Reply
Wow! Have to rate this 5 stars! 
I made a mod- I live in the UK now and don’t have any tajin so what I did instead was grate/zest a lime- to about half a teaspoon and then for the rest of the measurement added cayenne, salt and crushed red pepper. Was close enough to tajin! Actually I preferred it to tajin as sometimes tajin used to make my food taste a bit “fake lime”. Also couldn’t find any cilantro (lockdown making it hard) but it was delicious without it! 
Would make this again! Adding it to my regular dinner rotation! Thank you

We’ve made these A LOT. Super delicious. The only reason we’ve deviated from the original recipe is to accommodate allergies- gluten free, dairy free. Still easy to make. Several times I’ve come back to make just the slaw, and a few times the crema/sauce has been made & saved for salad dressing. Yum- 10 out of 10!

Wow! These were so delicious. I went back for a 3rd and really want a 4th but I’ll leave the rest for my husband. I have 3 cod fillets in the freezer and these are going on the menu again next week. The flavors work so well together. So easy and so tasty. Thanks GINA!

Dont have a gas stove How would prepare tolrtillas?
Misty — April 19, 2020 @ 10:16 pm Reply
I just put them in a hot skillet, maybe ten seconds or so, then flip. We use low-carb tortillas and sometimes I don’t care for the texture, but toasting them like this really helps! Yummy!

LOVE this recipe. I love fish tacos and after the first bite I was so excited about how delicious this turned out. Better than a restaurant. When I mentioned the recipe my fiance said he doesnt like fish tacos…then ended up loving these!

Had the family over for dinner and made both the fish tacos and the not fried retried beans. It was a great meal for the whole family! No instant pot, so did the beans in a crock pot. Drained well after about 6 1/2 hours on low and used the immersion blender. Great taste! The fish tacos were so delicious, they will definitely be made again! Thanks for all the recipes.

In the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, the grocery store shelves and meat counters are empty — I mean EMPTY, of chicken (unless I wanted to figure out what to do with wings, which I did not) and other essentials. The fish department had just gotten in their 3rd delivery for the day and the fresh cod looked amazing. So, that is the back story……. jump ahead to this recipe and wow! It was just the right amount of spice and the slightly charred corn tortillas gave it such a wonderful depth of flavor. I did not have the Tajin, so I found a recipe for it on line that I happened to have all the ingredients for. The slaw was light and added the perfect amount of freshness to the dish. 
I don’t think you will be disappointed in this recipe!

This are soooo delicious! I’ve made them twice in one week, once for my daughter and once for my granddaughter and they both agree with me, these are the best!

Wow, this meal definitely made the favorites list! No question! It actually might take the number one spot. I love fish tacos and this blew me away. Every element of this dish works together to make a fabulously bright meal just bursting with flavor! Don’t skimp on any of the elements of this dish. We paired it with the Instant Pot “refried” beans as suggested. What a treat it was to enjoy refried beans with no points! You are so talented, we appreciate you so much!

Hi Gina, this turned out to be a super delicious dinner. My boys loved it and were asking for more. I am adding it to my weekend dinner recipes.

How many pts for the corn tortillas?
84. Heidi S — March 5, 2020 @ 4:53 pm Reply
I grew up in San Diego and I am a fish taco snob. I have to say these were delicious and my new favorite fish tacos to make at home! Truly restaurant worthy but much healthier! I subbed mahi mahi as suggested because I happened to have some in my freezer. I put them in the air fryer for about 8 minutes because the pieces were thick. I don’t think you will save much time using the air fryer but I have a toddler so it is nice to be able to walk away from the kitchen while I’m cooking. Thank you GINA for another winner 😊

This recipe was fantastic!! We made it with shrimp since I had a frozen bag on hand and it was so good 😊 
86. Frances — March 3, 2020 @ 5:24 pm Reply
Great, didn’t have Tajin so used Penzey chili powder and squeezed half a lime over fish. Turned out very well. I used La Tortilla flour tortillas which we love, as I never seem to have luck with corn tortillas, I may not have tried the right brand, Will take suggestions. I find them either too thick or tough? I am not doing something right by them. Had some black beans and mango, as well. Very good, will make again.

89. anne flegal smith — March 2, 2020 @ 1:16 pm Reply
yum. These were delicious and easy to make. I used the wheat/corn tortillas and shredded cabbage both from TJoes which just made it that much simpler. Brought the leftovers for lunch today.

Well tonight my husband and I tried the Cod Fish Taco’s. Neither of us like Fat Free Greek Yogurt. Is there something else we could use instead of the Greek Yogurt? Or is there some other ingredients we could put in the sauce so that we don’t taste the yogurt? 
The seasoning by Taijan was delicious. I’m so glad that my local Target had it in stock.
We went to enter our points and I’m on the W.W. Purple Plan & my husband is on the W.W. Green Plan. The points on the bottom of the recipe aren’t the same points as W.W. Instead of being 5 pts for the purple plan they were 8 pts. For my husband who is on the green plan, the bottom of the recipe says 7 pts but they were 8 pts. Can you please tell me why is it different?
Thank you,
Gina — March 4, 2020 @ 9:48 am 
Sure you can use sour cream.
Did you use the WW calculator? 
The only accurate way to determine any recipe’s SmartPoints® value is to plug the ingredients into the recipe builder on the Weight Watchers website (Click on “My Foods,” select “Recipe,” and click “Create a recipe.”) 
The SmartPoints® calculator isn’t meant for recipes and will often give you the wrong points (usually higher) because it’s counting 0 points foods such as eggs, chicken, fruits and vegetables. So if you see a recipe with a SmartPoints® value that’s different from what the calculator tells you, that is why.

This sounds very tasty, however it would not ketogenic with the tortillas. I would substitute in some lettuce leaves to use as wraps or serve over chaffles.
91. SARA b FELTMAN — March 1, 2020 @ 5:21 pm Reply
anyone tried air frying the fish?
Gina — March 1, 2020 @ 5:22 pm Reply
Should take about 6 minutes on 400F.

I love Gina’s recipes so much, but almost always find the sauce quantities way inadequate. This recipe calls for 1/2 cup of sauce for 8 tacos, which is just 1 tablespoon per taco. Maybe with the slaw these won’t be too dry, but I’m guessing I wouldn’t notice the sauce at all. You can double the sauce, of course, but no telling what that would do to the points. Love Skinnytaste! Just a comment.

1 tablespoon of sauce per taco was more than enough! Try it and let me know if you agree!
anne smith — March 2, 2020 @ 1:17 pm 
agreed – it was more than enough and I am a sauce loving girl
Katrena — March 11, 2020 @ 10:37 pm Reply
We actually had sauce left over! It was really delicious too, but creamy, and 1 Tbsp is more than enough

Just in time for Lent! I made these last night & got rave reviews! Upped the. spicy/smoky factor with a large pinch of chipotle powder added to the fish seasoning. So, so good! You knocked it out of the ball park, Gina!

Yum! The boys have been asking for both fish tacos and new ways to use Tajin. This looks like a total win! Thank you so much, we’ll be enjoying these this week with some Spanish rice.

Do your servings include 2 tortillas per taco or 1?

No the photographer took the liberty to shoot them that way, I apologize.

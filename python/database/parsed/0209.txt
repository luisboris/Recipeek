Who else remembers the delicious endless bowls of soup and the buttery breadsticks from Olive Garden? So freakin’ good, right?
Today’s minestrone soup recipe is inspired by a little dose of nostalgia. When I was in high school my mom and I would frequent Olive Garden on a monthly basis just to find ourselves skipping the pasta and diving into their unbelievably delicious salad, warm breadsticks and of course, cozy bowls of minestrone soup.
I’ve made this vegetarian version of minestrone soup countless times over the past few months — each time switching up the recipe to make it unique. Sometimes I add ground turkey or beef and other times I skip the green beans and opt for spinach. However you do it, it’s going to be delicious and oh so easy.
Everything you’ll need to make minestrone soup
Traditional minestrone soup recipes are filled with plenty of nutrition; you get a variety of yummy vegetables, protein, fiber, incredible seasonings and of course, pasta. What’s not to love? Here’s what you’ll need:
Veggies: we’re packing this pot of minestrone soup with onion, celery, carrots, green beans (or sub zucchini or corn!), spinach and potatoes for extra bulk.
Broth: the veggies are simmered in a broth made with fire roasted crushed tomatoes and regular vegetable broth.
Protein: I love adding kidney beans for an extra boost of fiber and protein. Plus they have the BEST flavor in this soup.
Flavor: add a wonderful flavor boost with Italian seasoning and some red pepper flakes (if you like a little heat).
Noodles: what’s a minestrone soup without noodles? I like to use elbow noodles or shells, but feel free to use your favorite shape, gluten free if you’d like.
Optional: a delicious sprinkle of freshly grated parmesan and a side of toasted garlic bread.
All of these ingredients are simmered together in this super cozy minestrone soup that just happens to be vegetarian, vegan & gluten free friendly.
How do you make minestrone soup from scratch?
1. First, sauté your onion, celery, carrots and potato in a large pot for a few minutes until the onion is translucent.
2. Add in the crushed tomatoes, vegetable broth, kidney beans and seasonings, cover and cook for about 15 minutes.
3. Stir in the green beans, spinach and noodles, and cook for another 8-12 or so minutes until the pasta is al dente. Easy!
How to add ground turkey or beef to your minestrone soup
This minestrone soup recipe is incredibly easy to make and great for customizing! I’ve actually made it with ground turkey and ground beef for a hearty soup that packs even more protein.
To add more heartiness and protein with meat: saute 1 pound ground turkey or beef with the onions, carrots and potatoes until meat is broken up and nice and browned, then continue the recipe as written. Feel free to omit whatever you don’t have on hand, such as potatoes or green beans.
How to make slow cooker minestrone soup
1. Add all of your ingredients besides the spinach and noodles to your slow cooker.
2. Cook this on high for 3-4 hours or on low for 6-7 hours until the carrots and potatoes are fork-tender.
3. Once done cooking, add the noodles and spinach, cover again and cook on high for 15-20 minutes or until noodles are al dente.
What’s the difference between vegetable soup and minestrone soup?
Minestrone soup is essentially just a heartier version of a vegetable soup. Instead of only have vegetables, herbs and broth, this easy minestrone soup recipe packs extra nutrients from the potatoes, pasta and kidney beans. It’s a delicious lunch or dinner that will keep you full and satisfied.
What to eat with minestrone soup
Besides topping your delicious bowl with freshly grated parmesan, I love serving it with:
1. The Best Garlic Bread You’ll Ever Eat
2. Balsamic Herb Sheet Pan Roasted Vegetables
3. Gluten Free Cornbread Muffins
4. Pat’s 4-Ingredient Paleo Crackers
5. Shredded Brussels Sprouts & Kale Salad with Apple, Gorgonzola & Candied Pecans
How to store & freeze minestrone soup
Store this minestrone soup in the refrigerator in an airtight container for up to 5 days.
To freeze: I’d recommend freezing this soup without the added noodles, as they can become mushy while reheating. Let the soup completely cool, transfer it to a freezer-safe container, and store it in the freezer for up to 2 months.
To reheat: first let the soup thaw in the refrigerator. While it’s thawing you can make the 4oz of pasta on the stovetop. Heat the soup in the microwave or on the stovetop, and then add the cooked noodles.

Vegetarian minestrone soup packed with veggies like celery, carrots, green beans and spinach and simmered in a flavorful, Italian seasoned tomato broth. Use your favorite noodles in this minestrone soup recipe and pack in the protein with kidney beans! Delicious with a sprinkle of parmesan cheese and a side of garlic bread.
Ingredients
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 white or yellow onion, diced
2 stalks celery, diced
2 large carrots, sliced
1 medium (or 2 small) yukon gold potatoes, diced into ½ inch cubes (about 1 cup diced potatoes)
1 (28 ounce) can fire roasted crushed tomatoes
1 (15 ounce) can kidney beans, rinsed and drained
6 cups vegetable broth
1 teaspoon italian seasoning
1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes
3/4 teaspoon salt, plus more to taste
Freshly ground black pepper
8 ounces green beans, trimmed and cut into 1 inch pieces
4 cups spinach
4 ounces elbow noodles, small shells or fusilli, gluten free if desired
For serving:
Freshly grated parmesan
Garlic bread or crostinis
Instructions
1. Add olive oil to a large pot or dutch oven and place over medium high heat. Add in diced onion, celery, sliced carrots and potatoes. Saute for 3-5 minutes or until onions soften.
2. Next add in crushed tomatoes, kidney beans, vegetable broth, Italian seasoning, red pepper flakes and salt and pepper. Cover and cook on medium low for 10-15 minutes.
3. Next stir in the green beans, spinach and pasta. Cook uncovered for 8-12 more minutes or until pasta is al dente and green beans are tender. Pour into a bowl and serve with parmesan cheese on top. I also like to serve mine with garlic bread, crostinis or crackers. Personally I think soup makes amazing leftovers and is even more delicious the next day.
Recipe Notes
To make vegan: simply leave the cheese off the top or use your favorite vegan parmesan.
To add more heartiness and protein with meat: saute 1 pound ground turkey or beef with the onions and carrots until meat is nice and browned. Continue the recipe as written.
Make it in your slow cooker:
1. Add all of your ingredients besides the spinach and noodles to your slow cooker.
2. Cook this on high for 3-4 hours or on low for 6-7 hours until the carrots and potatoes are fork-tender.
3. In the last 10 minutes of cooking add the noodles and spinach and leave soup uncovered until noodles are al dente.
If you'd like you can sub 1 cup diced zucchini or corn in place of the green beans, or skip the greens beans all together.
To freeze: I'd recommend freezing this soup without the added noodles, as they can become mushy while reheating. Let the soup completely cool, transfer it to a freezer-safe container, and store it in the fridge for up to 2 months.
To reheat: first let the soup thaw in the refrigerator. While it's thawing you can make the 4oz of pasta on the stovetop. Heat the soup in the microwave or on the stovetop, and then add the cooked noodles.

I just made this tonight and it was EXCELLENT! I made with zucchini instead of green beans. Loved the kick from the red pepper flakes. Will definitely make again with some variations for fun, but this recipe is a keeper!

Hi! 
Excited to make this, 
Would you have any idea how to make it in a slow cooker?
Reply
Monique replied:
March 5, 2020
Absolutely! If you want to make in a slow cooker, add all ingredients except for the noodles and cook on low for 6-7 hours or high for 2-3 hours. I would also reduce the broth to 4 cups (instead of 6). Once it’s done, remove heat, add noodles and cook on high uncovered for 10-20 minutes or until noodles are done.

Loved this recipe! I made my own veggie broth (celery, carrots, bay leaves, garlic, & s/p) and it was so yummy! I used diced tomatoes instead of crushed fire roasted because that’s all I had, and it still had good heat with the crushed red pepper! Next time I think we’re going to sub chickpeas for the elbow noodles for less carbs / more protein. This is the perfect soup for a cold day!

This is going to be a keeper for me. The potatoes make it so good. I did not have canned tomatoes so I used fire roasted spaghetti sauce (Barilla) and I used dried lentils instead of the beans. I also added barely, always looking to add fiber. I topped my bowl with a little olive oil when finished!! This will be my go to veggie soup.

Loved this. I sautéed the carrots for a few minutes before the celery and onion because they always seem to take a bit longer to soften. I ended up leaving the completed soup on the lowest setting for an hour while I took a work call and it turned out delicious! This soup also saves extremely well.

This recipe has easily become on of our family favourites and a regular appearance on the dinner menu. Picture a silent table with only the sound of lips smacking to break the silence. Perfect excuse to use all my veggies in the fridge. 
I always do the pasta in a separate pot so the children get to choose how much pasta they have.

My husband loves Minestrone soup so I have been searching and searching for a soup recipe that we both would like. This one is 1000% a WINNER. I make it at least once a week in the fall and winter. Its super easy and the flavors are absolutely perfect. I usually sub fresh green beans for canned and leave out the potatoes. Once of my all time favorite soup recipes and I’m so glads its finally getting cooler so I can add this back into the rotation.

This recipe was absolutely delicious! Full of flavor and texture. Very quick and easy to make too! One tip I’ll use next time is to add a bit more vegetable broth (especially if you are really looking for a soup). I found the recipe as is to be delicious, but it felt more like a chili since it was so thick.

This soup is hands down the best new recipe to start off the new year with. The soup itself is packed with delicious veggies and has a nice kick to it with the red pepper flakes and seasoning. I made the garlic bread to go with it and it feels like a warm hug for a cold winter’s day: I would definitely make this again, for myself as a meal prep and for a small crowd when small gatherings become a thing again. Bravo!

I didn’t add potatoes or kidney beans, both to save on carbs and calories, but also because I don’t care for either of them. 
I don’t usually eat any kind of bread or crackers with my soup. 
And I used beef broth in mine. I’m not vegetarian, but we sometimes do have Meatless Monday. 
This soup is delicious. 
Some of my friends think it strange, but I love soup for breakfast. It’s so comforting and nutritious. This I’ve never understood…why do people put seasons on food?!? I don’t believe any food has a season. I cook and eat soup and any other foods any time of the year. If I want macaroni salad on a cold winter day in January I’m going to make macaroni salad and enjoy every bite. I’m not going to wait until July 4th to enjoy one of my favorite foods.

This is a wonderful soup recipe! So much good stuff—and so many veggies—in there. I don’t love watery soups, so I only used 4 cups of vegetable broth and it came out like a hearty vegetable chili! Just enough liquid to cook the noodles. I also topped it with some leftover part-skim ricotta, and it was great. This is a keeper. Thanks, Monique!

This was really good – made a HUGE portion! I subbed zucchini for green beans and couldn’t find fire roasted crushed tomatoes in my grocery stores. If you make this, try to find fire roasted tomatoes because I feel like mine lacked a little flavor and I was trying to alter/add more flavor with seasoning after it had simmered. That was my fault though and not an issue with the actual recipe.

Can’t say enough good things about this soup! I’ve always loved minestrone, but something about this recipe just takes it to the next level. I made it in the slow cooker and subbed sweet potatoes for Yukon golds. ALSO, the fire roasted crushed tomatoes definitely added flavor (as opposed to just regular crushed tomatoes) and I will definitely add to recipes in the future. My favorite noodles for this one are ditalini!

This was excellent! I love minestrone soup and was excited to make this. I had a hard time finding fire roasted crushed tomatoes and forgot kidney beans on my shopping list so ended up using crushed tomatoes with basil and cannellini beans. I thought it was perfect! I also withheld the red pepper flakes only because I planned to serve to my kids too. My husband kept telling me how good it was even though I didn’t add any meat…he’s a big meat guy. The meal was super easy to make too which is always important with kids…I prepped veggies while kids napped and everything was ready to be thrown in when I was ready to make it. Garlic bread on the side! Will definitely make again and perhaps try adding ground beef or maybe even cubed beef.

I really like this recipe. I have cooked it as written and have also used it as a base when we have a lot of veggies to use up! I throw a bayleaf in the pot and if I have it on hand, a parmesan rind while cooking.

I accidentally doubled the pasta so turned out more like a pasta dish than a soup, but was still so yummy! Will make again forsure.

This was the most wonderful chilly day dinner. Love that I can adapt the ingredients in this using what I have on hand. I added in some chickpeas I’m addition to the kidney beans since I had opened a can at lunch. The kidney beans and pasta were my favorite part. Highly recommend!

I loved this recipe!!1 It was very easy and very filling. I added more potatoes and pasta than it calls for because I love potatoes and pasta. I also ended up having to simmer it longer, but I think that was due to a cooking error on my part. Nonetheless, such a great recipe! I want to have garlic bread or crostini with it next time!

This is the BEST soup I have ever made. I am in shock that such simple, clean ingredients created the most delicious and filling soup. I loved the addition of spinach and shredded parm at the end of the recipe – totally elevated the recipe to restaurant level. Do yourself a favor and make Monique’s garlic bread when you serve this, it will get rave reviews!!

I didn’t have green beans so I used zucchini and added ground beef. Thanks for adding the suggestions. I used a little less broth so it would be thicker, just personal preference. It was perfect for the snow-mageddon day we’re having, and I’m sure it’ll be even better tomorrow. Thank you for another great recipe!

Love this soup! . . . The green beans really add some crunch and texture. I’m not a fan of spinach in soup, so I just increased the other veggies a bit (a touch more green beans, a couple more stalks of celery, 1 more carrot). It definitely yields 6 very hearty & filling servings. It keeps and reheats well, serves me and my husband for 3 nights straight. And grated parm on top is a must!

Delicious! I love how full of veggies and flavor this was. My grocery store only had diced fire roasted tomatoes, and I’m glad I chose them over regular crushed. I was able to add the tomatoes before the broth and chop them up a little bit before adding the broth, and it worked well. The only thing I would change next time is I would use less crushed red pepper – this had more of a bite than I expected/would have liked.

Perfect! And yes feel free to reduce the crushed red pepper flakes to keep the spice down. Glad you enjoyed!

This is delicious! I added a couple Parmigiano Reggiano cheese rinds to the pot to simmer with the soup, These can be purchased at whole foods. You’ll need to take it out before serving though. 
When serving, label soup in bowl place a homemade or store bought crostini toast on top, grate some fresh Parmigiano Reggiano on top and then drizzle some quality olive oil on top….its very good this way. 
Mangia mangia!

I am obsessed with this soup. I was never a fan of minestrone and could never figure out why (veggies, beans, pasta, what’s not to love?) until I realized it’s because I was eating all the wrong minestrone soups. I could eat this daily. Amazing with croutons, chefs kiss!

Made this soup for the first time tonight and it was a hit! Much thicker than I had anticipated. Used mostly items from the fridge that needed to be used and the soup was still delicious. The only change I made was to add mushrooms that had been hanging around awhile. 
We vote at our house to establish a 30 day menu – this one made the list. That is high praise, especially for something SO easy!
Thank you. Kathy

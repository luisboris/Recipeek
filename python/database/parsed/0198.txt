Emeril Lagasse

6 oz. salt cod
2 quarts milk
6 tbsp. olive oil
1 1/2 cups chopped onions
1/4 cup chopped bell peppers
1/4 cup chopped celery
11/4 cups peeled, seeded and chopped tomatoes
1/2 cup finely chopped cilantro
1/2 cup finely chopped parsley
2 tbsp. minced garlic
Pinch crushed red pepper
Salt and pepper
2 eggs, beaten
1/4 cup bread crumbs
1/2 cup flour
Essence - Rustic Rub
1/2 pound chouriço, finely chopped
1 cup fresh fava beans, blanched and peeled
1/2 cup white wine
1 cup chicken stock
Two days before serving, soak the cod in 1 quart of milk in a covered bowl and refrigerate for 24 hours. The next day, discard the milk and rinse the cod well under cold water. Place the cod in a fresh quart of milk and refrigerate for another 24 hours. Remove the fish and rinse under cold water. Julienne the fish and set aside.
In a sauté pan, heat 3 tablespoons of olive oil. When the oil is hot, add 1/4 cup chopped onions, all of the bell peppers and all of the celery. Season with salt and pepper. Sauté for 1 minute. Add 1/4 cup tomatoes, 1/4 cup cilantro, 1/4 cup parsley and one tablespoon of garlic. Sauté 1 minute more. Season with crushed red pepper, salt and pepper. Add the cod and sauté for 4 minutes. Remove from the heat and turn into a mixing bowl.
Stir in the eggs and bread crumbs. Form the filling into four cakes, 1/2 cup per cake. Season the four fish cakes with Essence. Dredge the cakes in the seasoned flour and set aside.
In a sauté pan, render the chouriço for 3 minutes. Add the fava beans, the remaining onions, tomatoes, garlic, cilantro and parsley. Season with salt and pepper. Sauté for 2 minutes. Add the wine and chicken stock and simmer for 2 minutes more.
In a sauté pan, heat the remaining 3 tablespoons of olive oil. When the oil is hot, pan-fry the cod fish cakes for 2 minutes per side. Remove the cakes from the pan and drain on a paper-lined plate. Season with Essence.*
To assemble, spoon the stewed fava beans in the center of a plate. Place the salt cod cakes on top of the fava beans. Garnish with freshly chopped parsley.
Serves 4.

Nomato Sauce (Nightshade Free Tomato Sauce Alternative)

5 from 4 reviews
Nomato sauce is a dairy free, nightshade free, and anti-inflammatory tomato sauce alternative, and it tastes like marinara sauce! Full of antioxidants and nutrients, too._
Y‚Äôall, it‚Äôs been one heck of a year, hasn‚Äôt it? I say this in both a positive way and a negative way. I mean, there are usually good times intertwined with bad ones, right? 
We‚Äôll get to the nomato sauce recipe in just a minute. But first, let‚Äôs focus on the GOOD events of 2020.
1. COOKING FOR NOURISHMENT ‚Äì We made good food for our bodies this year, and a LOT of it! In total, there were 106 new posts published here, including 6meal plans! 
2. LEARNING- We learned how to eat on a budget, about the benefits of olive oil , and how plant based meals and proteins like tempeh can improve the way we feel. Oh, and let‚Äôs not forget about those helpful food storage tips. 
3. COMMUNITY- Even though we still need to socially distance for the health of others and ourselves, we have a helpful and supportive online community of like-minded, gluten free eaters. We spent a lot of time lifting one another‚Äôs spirits in a time of uncertainty.
Y‚Äôall are kind, decent people, and I‚Äôm happy to know you, even if only in a virtual way. Be proud of the fact that you are here at the end of a long year, still standing tall! üôÇ
Okay, now let‚Äôs talk about one of the most incredible sauces that will ever cross your taste buds! You may think I‚Äôm exaggerating, but I‚Äôm not- it‚Äôs TRUE!
Nomato sauce doesn‚Äôt have any real tomatoes in it, because it is nightshade free. We‚Äôll get more into that next month.
The important thing is, nobody will realize that tomatoes are missing from this sauce. Unless you tell them, of course. 
Actually, this tomato sauce alternative just might be the best tasting fake marinara sauce that you will ever eat! Haha.
What‚Äôs in nomato sauce?
The ingredients in this anti inflammatory recipe are wholesome and nourishing. You know‚Ä¶ REAL FOOD ingredients. 
NOTE: _This isn‚Äôt the entire ingredient list‚Ä¶ just the key components. You can see the full list and amounts in the recipe card at the bottom of the post._
Beets ‚Äì You can use purple beets or golden beets. Nutritionally, they are equal. The difference is in the flavor, because purple beets have a sweeter flavor than the golden variety. 
Of course, the color of the sauce will be more of an orange-red color. But hey, you won‚Äôt end up with purple fingers after peeling them! 
Beetroot is an antioxidant-rich vegetable. It‚Äôs full of nutrients, including:
Vitamins B9 and C
Iron
Potassium
Manganese
Among other things, beets may help reduce inflammation and improve digestion!
Carrots- The beta-carotene and Vitamin A in carrots helps to fight oxidative stress on your eyes. Plus, this is another antioxidant veggie. Woo-hoo‚Ä¶ TWO FOR TWO! 
Pumpkin puree ‚Äì If you prefer another squash, butternut, acorn, feel free to make homemade puree. It‚Äôs as easy as boiling or steaming the fresh squash, then pureeing it with a stick blender, or tossing it into a high speed blender for a couple of minutes. 
Garlic- There are plenty of nutritional benefits to be found here! Garlic is a super defense against bacteria and viruses. Supposedly, it‚Äôll chase away a vampire or two as well. Or, so I‚Äôve heard. üòâ
Finally, this tomato free pasta sauce is great for almost any dietary need. It‚Äôs nightshade free, dairy free, vegan, paleo, nut free, Whole30, and of course, gluten free. 
Watch the recipe video!
This tomato free pasta sauce is made in a snap, using an immersion blender (stick blender) or a traditional blender. Watch this video to see how it‚Äôs done!

How to make Nomato Sauce
1\. Cook the veggies.
Now, peeling and chopping beets and carrots and then cooking them may seem like a pain, I know, it means extra work. 
One important reason to do this rather than using canned or frozen veggies is for better flavor! Also, you really want the beets to have as much moisture as possible so that the sauce isn‚Äôt too thick.
2\. Puree the cooked vegetables.
If you own a stick blender (aka, immersion blender), this is the time to use it! Of course, if this isn‚Äôt an option for you, it‚Äôs not a problem; you can still make the recipe. 
Just transfer the cooked veggies over to a blender to puree them. Then, add them back to the pan to finish making the nomato sauce.
3\. Adjust the consistency if needed, then simmer.
After you make a puree with the beets, carrots, squash, garlic, and a few spices, you‚Äôll want to adjust the thickness of the sauce to your liking.
This can be done in one of two ways. You can use extra vegetable broth to thin it out. Or, if you‚Äôre planning to use it as a tomato free pasta sauce, you can thin the sauce with some of the pasta water. Easy peasy.
RECIPE NOTES
How to store nomato sauce 
Keep the sauce in a sealed container in the fridge, and use it up within a week. For longer storage, it can be frozen for up to 1 month.
For a sweeter sauce, use purple beets. For a lighter, more neutral flavor (with less pink stain), use golden beets. 
It is possible to make this recipe using pre-cooked beets and carrots. However, the flavor will be muted, and the sauce will be much thicker, so you will definitely need to use additional broth.

Description
Nomato sauce is a dairy free, nightshade free, and anti-inflammatory tomato sauce alternative, and it‚Äôs delicious! Full of antioxidants and nutrients, you can make this easy sauce recipe in your blender.
Ingredients
Scale 1x2x3x
1 tbsp olive oil
2/3 cup chopped yellow onion
2 garlic cloves, minced (or 1 tsp garlic powder)
1 cup diced beets (1 large raw beet, peeled- purple or golden)
1 cup diced carrots (1\--2 large carrots, peeled)
1 tsp Italian seasoning
1 tsp dried oregano
1 pinch kosher or sea salt
1 1/2 cups vegetable broth (use more for a thinner sauce)
1 cup canned or fresh pumpkin puree (or other squash puree)
1 tbsp chopped fresh parsley
1 tbsp lemon juice and/or 2 tsp balsamic vinegar for extra tang (I use a combo of both)
Optional add-in: 1 tbsp pitted diced olives, capers, nutritional yeast
Instructions
1. Heat oil in large skillet over medium heat, then add and saute the onions until tender and golden, about 10 minutes. Add minced garlic and saute until fragrant, about 1 minute.
2. Add beets, carrots, Italian seasoning, oregano, and 1/4 tsp salt. Stir together. Add 1 cup vegetable broth. Cover and cook over medium heat until carrots and beets are fork-tender, 20 to 30 minutes. The broth will almost be absorbed by then. Once cooked, transfer ingredients in the pot to a blender. See photos in blog post.
3. Add 1/2 cup broth and pumpkin/squash puree, then blend until smooth. Alternatively , add 1/2 cup broth and pumpkin/squash puree to the pot and use a stick blender to blend into a puree. _Note: For thinner pasta sauce, increase amount of broth to reach desired consistency._ Then, add fresh parsley, lemon juice and/or balsamic vinegar, and any optional add-ins, and blend again until smooth.
4. Transfer ingredients back into the pot (if you used a blender) and simmer over medium heat for 10 minutes.
5. Store in a sealed container in fridge for up to a week, or freeze for up to 1 month.
Notes
For a sweeter sauce, use purple beets. For a lighter, more neutral flavored sauce (with less pink stain), use golden beets.
It is possible to make this recipe using pre-cooked beets and carrots. However, the flavor will be muted, and the sauce will be much thicker, so you will need to use additional broth.

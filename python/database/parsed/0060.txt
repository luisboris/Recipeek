Kuku

Kuku_ (or _kookoo_ ) is a very popular egg-based Azeri and Persian dish.
Among the 2,000 Azerbaijani dishes that we mentioned in our _dovga_ soup article, kuku (pronounced kyukyu) is the star of breakfasts and appetizers.
What is kuku?
This appetizer gets its origins in Persian cuisine. Generally, this is the name given to dishes whose main ingredients including vegetables, herbs, meat or fish, are bound with eggs and browned on each side on a skillet or, more rarely, in an oven. One should not confuse kuku with an omelet because proportionately, the ingredients of a kuku are used in much greater quantities than eggs.

By its appearance and texture, kuku is a close cousin to Persian _kookoo_ , Middle-Eastern _eggah_ , a Spanish tortilla or Italian _frittata_.
How to make kuku sabzi
The simplest version and by far the most popular is called _goyerti k√ºk√ºs√º_ (with fresh herbs). It is called _kookoo sabzi_ in Iran. It is possible to add fresh mint and spinach to the herbs in the preparation.
It was often served with crushed walnuts or just with whole walnuts on top. It can also be served with a garlicky yogurt sauce, which is by far the most authentic version.
Azeris prepare many different types of them with a wide variety of aromas, including, to name a few, potato kuku ( _kuku sib-zamini_ ), eggplant kuku ( _kuku-ye bademjan_ ), and chicken kuku ( _kuku-ye morgh_ ).

This looks great. How many cups of chopped cilantro, dill and mint does a bunch equate to?

Hey Lindsay, about 1 to 1-1/2 cup of each for chopped cilantro and dill. And about 3/4 cup for chopped mint.

Wonderful Rosa. Yes, this version is kuku sabzi, but there are quite a few variations, including with eggplant.

I‚Äôm an Ashkenazi Jew from Azerbaijan 33 years ago. 
I remember my Azeri friends made Kuku (kukya) like you would do a shakshuka but with all greens instead of tomatoes. The point is that you saute all herbs, garlic, spring onion, etc, first when they are still soft like tomatoes in Shakshuka would, and THEN pour eggs on the top and cook to your liking. 
Just a variation.
I‚Äôm very interested in worldwide cousin and so glad I found your site when was looking for a Phkaila recipe. 
My friends and I decided we will make a World around tour by cooking foods from different countries. 
I learned how made sushi, egg drop soup, fried rice, Pho soup, etc. So I would be coming here often.
Happy Rosh Hashana, a Sweet New Year, and the very best from my family to yours.

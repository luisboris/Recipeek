Low Carb Waffled Tuna Cakes

Low Carb Waffled Tuna Cakes
These Keto & Low Carb Waffled Tuna Cakes are an inexpensive appetizer, side dish or meal. They’re loaded with Healthy Fats and Protein and can be thrown together in a few minutes with Items from your Pantry. I used Solid White Albacore Tuna, which is better quality but the recipe can be made with any canned tuna or salmon you have on hand.
How to Make Low Carb Waffled Tuna Cakes
You’ll Love how easy these Keto Tuna Cakes are to make. First you drain the liquid off of the Tuna, then add it to a mixing bowl. Add the egg, garlic, mayonnaise, lemon juice, crushed pork rinds or bread crumbs, onion powder and salt and pepper. Mix until very well combined.
Then preheat your waffle iron. Use the melted butter to coat the hot iron, then divid the tuna mixture into 6. Place a ball of the the tuna mixture onto the centre of the greased iron. Cook until golden Brown. Serve with a side of Dill Pickle Dip and Lemon.
WHAT IS THE KETOGENIC DIET?
The ketogenic diet (often called _keto_ ) is a very low-carb, high-fat diet that shares similarities to paleo, Whole30, and Atkins. It involves drastically reducing carbohydrate intake, and replacing it with fat. When in ketosis, your body switches to burning fat for its primary fuel source.
On Keto, you’re supposed to get at least 70 percent of your calories from Fat, 15 to 25 percent from Protein, and 10 percent from Carbohydrates. You should avoid all grains, legumes, root vegetables, fruit, (except berries) and sugar.
Low Carb Waffled Tuna Cakes
I like making these Low Carb Waffled Tuna Cakes on a Hot Summer Day because the Waffle Iron doesn’t Heat up my House as much as using the Stove or Oven would. On really hot days, I’ve even plugged it in outside. It makes dinner time so easy and the best part is you’re family will absolutely love them. These crispy and satisfying fish cakes can be made ahead of time and then reheated in the oven or toaster oven. They can even be reheated in the waffle iron.
Are you looking for some more delicious Keto Recipes? You’re in luck! I have some of my families favourite recipes to share. Our absolute fav are these Keto Coconut Protein Pancakes. I love that they’re so easy and quick to make. Another one of our favourites, are these tasty Keto Strawberry French Toast Cups. They’re perfect for impressing brunch guests or for spoiling someone special.
Recipe Notes:
Almond or coconut flour can be used in place of the pork rinds if preferred.
The tuna cakes can be cooked in a frying pan or in the oven instead of the waffle iron.
The canned tuna can be switched out for canned chicken, crab or salmon.

This was so good❗️ Thank-you for the great recipe and dill pickle dip. I didn’t think about taking a photo but so pretty too. We had two each over a romaine leaf and feta sprinkled over the top.

Loved, loved, loved these! I didn’t have carbs all day, so I could use panko bread crumbs in this recipe (the husband refused to eat any more almond flour hahaha). He and our daughter also enjoyed them. Thank you for the recipe!

You can just skip them all together or add a small amount of almond or coconut flour.

Hi! Can you use anything to substitute for the egg? I’m on an AIP diet.

I think you could skip the egg altogether but if you find it’s a little to dry you could add a little more of the butter and mayonnaise.

I’m allergic to egg so I’m going to try this with vegenaise and a flaxseed egg substitute. Good luck!

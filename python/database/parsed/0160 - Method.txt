Preparation steps:
1. Mix the flour and dunst with butter and oil
2. Add the rest of the ingredients
3. Add hot water and knead to obtain a coherent and soft dough (slightly softer than bread dough)
4. Put the dough in a bowl, cover with a damp cloth and leave to rest for 12h
5. Shape the dough into balls then flatten them
6. Use special “kaak stamps” to make the traditional impressions
7. Bake in a pre-heated oven until light golden brown (about 20 – 30 min)

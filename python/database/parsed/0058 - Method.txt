Instructions
1. Heat oil in large skillet over medium heat, then add and saute the onions until tender and golden, about 10 minutes. Add minced garlic and saute until fragrant, about 1 minute.
2. Add beets, carrots, Italian seasoning, oregano, and 1/4 tsp salt. Stir together. Add 1 cup vegetable broth. Cover and cook over medium heat until carrots and beets are fork-tender, 20 to 30 minutes. The broth will almost be absorbed by then. Once cooked, transfer ingredients in the pot to a blender. See photos in blog post.
3. Add 1/2 cup broth and pumpkin/squash puree, then blend until smooth. Alternatively , add 1/2 cup broth and pumpkin/squash puree to the pot and use a stick blender to blend into a puree. _Note: For thinner pasta sauce, increase amount of broth to reach desired consistency._ Then, add fresh parsley, lemon juice and/or balsamic vinegar, and any optional add-ins, and blend again until smooth.
4. Transfer ingredients back into the pot (if you used a blender) and simmer over medium heat for 10 minutes.
5. Store in a sealed container in fridge for up to a week, or freeze for up to 1 month.

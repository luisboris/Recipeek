Directions
Peel the eggplants, the slice them and then cut the slices into strips about the size of your little finger. 
Salt the eggplant strips generously and lay the in a colander inside a bowl. Top with a small plate and weigh the plate down. (A small can of tuna, beans or tomatoes works well.) Leave to rest overnight. 
The next day, as pictured above, a considerable amount of liquid should have drained into the bowl. Discard that. Take the eggplant strips by the handful and squeeze them of as much of their remaining liquid as you can. 
Bring the vinegar and water to a boil in a saucepan. Add the eggplant by the handful and boil each batch for 2 minutes. Drain and let cool completely.
When the eggplant strips are cool enough to handle, squeeze them again of their excess liquid. 
Now, place the eggplant strips in a mason jar or other air-tight container, layering them with bits of garlic, _peperoncino_ and herbs. 
Press everything down to compact the contents of the jar, then add as much olive oil as you need to cover the eggplant strips completely. 
Close the jar tightly and let it rest in a cool, dry place for at least a couple of days, preferably a week, before consuming.

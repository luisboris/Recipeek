Instructions
1. Heat a large pot over medium heat. Place butter in pot and melt, coating the pan.
2. Place your onions in the pot and saute for 5 minutes. Add the sliced mushrooms and saute for an additional 5 minutes until mushroom are browned and coated in butter. Onions will brown as well.
3. Stir in the wine, dill, paprika, tamari sauce and broth. Reduce heat to low, cover and simmer for 15 minutes.
4. In a separate small bowl, whisk the thickening mixture; non dairy milk and arrowroot flour. Pour the flour milk mix into the soup and stir thoroughly to blend. Cover pot and simmer for 15 more minutes, stirring occasionally. 
5. Finally, stir in the salt, ground black pepper, lemon juice, parsley and yogurt (or solid coconut cream). Mix together and allow to heat through over low heat, about 3 to 5 minutes. Do not boil.
6. Garnish with extra chopped parsley and cracked pepper. Serve immediately or let it cool and store in airtight container in fridge. 
7. May be placed in freezer for up to 3 months. 
Notes
3 tablespoons refined avocado oil or olive oil may be substituted for butter
_To lower carbs, use full fat coconut cream versus yogurt. For solid coconut cream or milk, be sure to keep the can in the fridge to chill._

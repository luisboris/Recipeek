Tzatziki
Start by making the tzatziki. Put the grated cucumber in a fine-mesh sieve and drain over a bowl for at least 1 hour but longer if you can. If you don't do this, your tzatziki will be watery. 
How to make Lamb Koftas
Mix the spices and herbs with the lamb mince. Season and fry a tiny amount so you can taste and adjust the seasoning if needed. 
Divide the mixture and shape around your wooden skewers. 
Mix the drained cucumber and the rest of the tzatziki ingredients together in a bowl. 
If you don't like dill you can use mint instead; or a mixture of both! Just be sure to only add the fresh herbs when you're ready to serve or they will discolour. 
Grill the koftas, get the pitta bread ready and whip a Greek salad and you're all set to dive in!

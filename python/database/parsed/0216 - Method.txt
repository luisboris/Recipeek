Instructions: Combine the all-purpose and cake flour with the salt and sugar. Whisk together to mix the ingredients evenly.
Using your fingers, cut the shortening into the flour mixture until it resembles coarse corn meal. Using your fingers, toss the butter into the flour mixture. Allow the slices of butter to break up into slightly smaller pieces into the flour. Work quickly so the butter doesn’t get warm. Don’t break the butter down completely. There should be some large flakes remaining.
Pour the sourdough discard onto the flour all at once and toss to combine. Gently press the dough just until it comes together. It will look a little dry in spots. The moisture will redistribute in the dough as it rests.
Wrap the dough and refrigerate for at least 2-3 hours before using.
Divide the dough into 4 portions. Roll the dough into circles about 1/4-inch thick. Place the filling in the center of the circles and moisten the edge of the dough with a bit of water. Fold the dough over the filling and crimp it closed with a fork.
Transfer the empanadas to a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Brush the surface of each with the egg. Bake at 400 degrees until the empanadas are nicely browned, 35-40 minutes, and serve hot.

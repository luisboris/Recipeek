The Best Lentil Shepherd's Pie
75.6K shares
Jump to Recipe
There was a moment where I wasn't going to post this recipe for The Best Lentil Shepherd's Pie. After all, there are a TON of lentil shepherd’s pie recipes floating around. It’s not exactly ground-breaking material.
But then something happened… I pulled some of my leftover lentil shepherd’s pie from the freezer, warmed it up, and devoured the whole thing. And guess what? It really is The Best Lentil Shepherd's Pie.
What makes this Lentil Shepherd's Pie the best?
Why thank you for asking. There are 3 simple and scrumptious reasons.
1. These lentils are jam-packed full of veggie deliciousness: carrots, mushrooms, peas, and are seasoned perfectly with thyme, onions, garlic, and an extra zing of BBQ sauce. Boom! Simple and totally drool-worthy.
2. Garlic mashed potatoes. Those aren't any plain old regular mashed potatoes, they're packed full of garlic and creamy coconut milk making them light years above any other mash.
3. This hearty meal is perfect for a holiday, weekend, or just something to last you throughout the week. It can be made in advance and then just warmed in the oven. You can serve it in a fancy casserole dish or go rustic like I like to do, and serve it in a skillet. This pie will satisfy anyone and everyone making it a perfect dish for any occasion!
I hope you love it as much as I do.
To Make the Lentil Shepherd's Pie:
Chop up your veggies, and prep for the mash potatoes.
Heat the oil in a large frying pan or skillet over medium-high heat. Add in the onion, carrots, mushrooms, garlic, and thyme and sauté for 6 to 8 minutes until softened and bits are browned. Remove from pan, and set aside.
Return the pan to heat, add in the lentils, and vegetable broth. Cover, and simmer for 25 - 30 minutes until the broth is absorbed and the lentils are tender.
While the lentils cook, prepare the mashed potatoes and try not to eat them all.
When the lentils are cooked through, add the vegetables back to the pan, and add the peas, BBQ sauce, and soy sauce. Heat through. Scoop the mixture into a casserole dish or large skillet and then spread the mashed potatoes on top.
Bake for 10 - 15 minutes until the lentil shepherd's pie is hot and bubbling around the edges.

Quick Prep: For a quicker prep, you can use canned cooked lentils. Just drain and rinse before using and crumble 1 vegetable bouillon cube in with the lentils and stir to combine.
Oil-free: cut down on oil by doing a water or broth sauté.

Hi Sam. I haven't made this but I'm going to give it five stars anyway - I know it will be great. I love all your recipes.
Quick question & request: Would you say this recipe is freezable, and at what stage (pre- or post-bake)? And my request is that you more frequently put whether a dish is freezable in your notes? I live alone so a meal for 8 is a lot - but if I'm going to cook, I also want to make the whole thing. I'd love to put half in the freezer and have it again in a few weeks.

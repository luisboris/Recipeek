Instructions 
In a small bowl combine lime juice, honey, soy sauce.
Salt the chicken thighs with Â½ teaspoon of salt (or more) thoroughly, all over, including under the skin.
In 12-inch skillet, heat olive oil over medium-high heat. Add chicken thighs, skin side down, and cook for about 5 minutes until the chicken skin side gets nicely browned (make sure to get really nice brown, not just pale brown - it makes a difference in presentation).
Turn chicken, so that skins sides are up and add lime-honey mixture to the skillet. Reduce heat to low; cover and cook 14 to 18 minutes longer or until done (chicken should register 180 degrees F on instant thermometer). While cooking, covered, chicken thighs will release their own juices, as well.
Transfer chicken to plates. Drizzle chicken with pan juices. Top with chopped green onions and serve with lime slices.

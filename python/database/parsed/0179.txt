Healthy Gluten Free Carrot Cake
April 19, 2021 / No Comments
Jump to Recipe Print Recipe
Healthy gluten free carrot cake – If you follow my instagram and blog… you know I eat gluten! so this recipe may sound very out of my league… but I decided to make it because my mother makes this delicious carrot cake using Almond Flour which I wanted to replicate making it healthier without using processed sugars.
So, that is how this recipe was born! not with the intention of making it gluten free, but with the idea of making a healthier, super moist and delicious carrot to snack at home!
My goal is always to make baked goods tasty – I don’t have the intention of making something “healthy” and compromising the flavor on the way. And I feel this carrot cake is absolutely that! (Make sure to let me know how you like it!).
If you check the recipe below, this healthy gluten free carrot cake has no refined sugars and the ingredients are super simple! The bake takes 45 minutes, and you will have a super moist and soft carrot cake. I thought about layering it and filling it – but maybe next time? 
What flours does this healthy paleo and gluten free carrot cake recipe use?
This recipe uses almond flour from Bob’s Red Mill and also some tablespoons of old fashioned rolled oats from Quaker.
What sugar does it use?
It doesn’t use refined sugars. The recipe I created only has Maple Syrup but feel free to substitute it for Honey – I’ve done it with both and its equally yummy.
What oil does the carrot cake use?
I used coconut oil, but feel free to substitute it for the oil of your choice.
Is it dairy free?
It is! There is no dairy in this healthy paleo and gluten free carrot cake.

I had the honor to teach 2 virtual team buildings this weekend ❤
Attendees from: UK, Portugal, France, Belgium, Germany, Poland, Australia, Singapore, China, Malaysia... wow!
We made a galette...but most importantly, we had fun and had 90 minutes to focus on being present ❤ with our hands covered in flour and butter.
Perfect during Thanksgiving weekend - because I cant be more grateful for doing this!
Hope everyone had a beautiful holiday!!

This traditional Apple Strudel Recipe is made with a simple dough that bakes
up into a flaky, buttery crust and a juicy, spiced apple filling studded with
rum-soaked raisins and finely chopped almonds. An impressive dessert that’s
perfect for special occasions and the holiday season!
I love to serve this Apfelstrudel warm topped with vanilla ice cream or
homemade vanilla sauce. It’s one of my favorite desserts during fall and
winter!
Making the dough from scratch might be intimidating but it’s actually easier
than it seems. I went through a few fails to make this recipe as foolproof as
possible for you and I’ll share all my tips and tricks to make a traditional
German Apple Strudel at home that tastes like the one you’ve tried on
vacation!

Where does apple strudel come from
Did you know that Apple Strudel is not really a German pastry? It originated
in Austria and is popular in many countries in Europe that once belonged to
the Austro-Hungarian Empire. Germany wasn’t part of this empire but many
popular Austrian dishes like Kaiserschmarrn or Apfelstrudel are also part of
the Bavarian cuisine because of the proximity to Austria.
What type of pastry is used for strudel?
Traditional Viennese Apple Strudel is made with strudel dough. A soft dough
made with only a handful of ingredients that’s hand-stretched into a paper-
thin sheet the size of a tabletop. But many are afraid of making a strudel
dough, so recipes these days often cheat by using sheets of purchased phyllo
dough or puff pastry.
I think if you want to make traditional Apple strudel you should give the
strudel dough a try! It really is easier than you think and by not aiming for
a paper-thin dough you will be rewarded with a delicious strudel that is
easier to make than the Austrian Grandmother version but not less delicious.

How to make Apple Strudel from scratch
Start with making the dough. This dough recipe is pretty straightforward.
Melted butter, flour, lukewarm water, and a little bit of salt are combined
until a smooth dough forms. I use my Kitchen Aid for making the dough and it
does the job in less than a minute.
Now comes a step that will make stretching the dough so much easier. Let the
dough rest in a hot small pot covered with a lid. This makes the dough elastic
and easier to handle.
![A stainless steel pot, lined with parchment paper, with a fogged-up glass
lid.][8]![A stainless steel pot, lined with parchment paper, with a fogged-up
glass lid.][12]
While the dough is resting make the apple filling. You want it to be ready
before you start rolling out and stretching the dough because if the dough
gets dry it will tear and you might end up with a huge mess. While testing
this recipe I nearly had a breakdown because my strudel ripped open in the
oven and the apple filling spilled out.
So my tips to prevent that from happening are:
1. Don’t be over ambitious! Yes, Austrian grandmothers can stretch the dough only with their hands paper-thin in less than a minute but none of us is an Austrian Granny. You want to see the pattern of your dish towel through the dough but that’s enough in my opinion. You will get better and faster at this with time but please don’t aim for A+ the first time!
2. Use a smooth dish towel! I tried it once with a rough towel and the dough stuck to it.
3. Have the apple filling prepared in advance! You don’t want the stretched out dough laying around too long or it will get dry.
4. Remove all your jewelry and push up your sleeves! Rings, bracelets or even your sleeves could ruin your dough.
If you follow these tips making the dough is really not that hard!

thin, that the grey plaid pattern of the towel shines through.][8]![Dough for

For the apple filling, I prefer to cut the apples into small stripes
(batonnets). Some people also like to cut the apples into small slices. Then
combine the apple and the other ingredients.
Rum-soaked raisins are essential for making a good apple strudel. Just combine
rum and raisins (I like to use golden raisins) and let them sit for about 30
minutes. Then discard (or drink) the rum and add the raisins to the filling.
If you can’t use rum you can soak them in lukewarm water or apple juice.
The nuts in the filling are optional. I really like them in the filling but
only if they are finely chopped. If you find finely chopped blanched almonds
at the store use these or finely chop store-bought slivered almonds.
![A white bowl containing apples cut into sticks, with raisins and a spoon in
it.][8]![A white bowl containing apples cut into sticks, with raisins and a

There are different ways to spread the apples over the dough. I find the
easiest and most foolproof way is to make one stripe of filling, about
6-inches thick. You want to roll up the dough from the short end so with the
long side facing you, leave a few inches space on the right side of the
rectangle then sprinkle the breadcrumbs top to bottom over the dough in a
6-inch thick line. Leave a 2-inch margin at the top and bottom of the strip.
Pile the apple filling on top of the breadcrumbs. To avoid adding too much
liquid use a slotted spoon to transfer the filling onto the dough. Make a
uniform pile and then fold the dough at the top and bottom over onto the
filling then roll up the strudel from the short side with the help of the
towel. Be careful and work slowly, it’s similar to making a swiss roll.
Brush the strudel with a little bit of melted butter, then put it in the oven
for 50 minutes. While it’s baking brush it with more melted butter every 20
minutes.

grey plaid dishtowel and a rolled, unbaked apple strudel on top.][16]
Can Apple Strudel be made in advance?
I think it tastes best warm from the oven but it also tastes great at room
temperature or reheated in the oven for a few minutes. I wouldn’t recommend to
assemble the apple strudel in advance and then bake it on the next day because
the apples will soak the dough. You can make the dough in advance and store it
covered in the fridge overnight, let it come to room temperature before
rolling it out.
You could also freeze the assembled but not baked apple strudel and then bake
it a few minutes longer when you want to serve it. But I haven’t tried this
method myself, I’ll update this post if I try it.
What to serve with Apple Strudel?
Apfelstrudel is always sprinkled with powdered sugar and most of the time
served with vanilla sauce. It tastes also great with whipped cream or a big
dollop of vanilla ice cream. I love it with ice cream! Vanilla ice cream with
warm strudel = HEAVEN!

▢ 1/4 cup breadcrumbs, (30g)
Cook ModePrevent your screen from going dark
Instructions
In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment combine melted butter, flour, salt, and lukewarm water. Mix at medium speed about 1 minute until a smooth and elastic dough forms.
In a small saucepan (with a lid) bring water to a boil then remove the pot from the heat, empty the pot and dry it with a dish towel. Line the pot with a sheet of parchment paper, put the dough into the pot and put the lid on. Let sit for 30 minutes at room temperature.
Preheat the oven to 350°F (180°C) and line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
Meanwhile, in a small bowl combine raisins and rum. Let sit for 30 minutes. Then discard the rum.
Peel, core, and cut the apples into small stripes (batonnets, see image above). Combine apples with lemon juice. Add cinnamon, sugar, raisins, almonds, and vanilla extract. Set aside.
Lay a thin kitchen towel preferably with a pattern flat on the counter.
Sprinkle with flour. Roll the dough out as thin as you can. Brush it with a little bit of melted butter.
Then use your hands to carefully stretch it until it is about 18x12 inches (45x30 cm) big and you're able to see the pattern of the dish towel through the dough.
Brush half of the melted butter over the rolled out dough.
The long side should be facing you. On the right side of the rectangle, leave a few inches space, then sprinkle the breadcrumbs top to bottom over the dough in a 6-inch thick line. Leave a 2-inch margin at the top and bottom of the strip.
Pile the apple filling on top of the breadcrumbs. Use a slotted spoon so the liquid stays in the bowl.
Fold the 2-inch margin at the top and bottom of the dough over onto the filling then roll up the strudel from the short side with the help of the towel. Tuck the ends.
Carefully transfer the Strudel to the prepared baking sheet, seam side down. Brush with a little bit of melted butter.
Bake for about 50 minutes in the lower third of the oven, until lightly golden on top. Brush strudel with remaining melted butter every 20 min while in the oven.
Let cool for 10 minutes then sprinkle with powdered sugar and serve warm.

I was very excited to make this recipe as a treat for my German father in law.  
Upon making the pastry I found that the fat and water amounts were not enough
for the dough to come together. I needed to add approximately 1 table more
melted butter and 2 tablespoons more water.  
After that the dough was a dream to work with.  
A useful tip for working with the dough on the tea towel is dusting the towel
with flour. I was successfully able to hand stretch the dough too the point I
could see the pattern of the towel.  
The strudel is now in the oven, is picture perfect and smells heavenly.  
I’m going to make a quick vanilla sauce with custard powder to serve with it.  
Thank you so much for your recipe!!

Yes, you can make it ahead of time but I would recommend freezing the baked
apple strudel. Just let it cool completely, wrap it airtight, and freeze it
then let it thaw and put it in the oven at 350 F for about 10-15 min to
reheat. Refrigerating it for a few days will make it soggy.

I have a made a French tart with a much simpler procedure and have come out
good. Being the first time with this recipe I ended having too much apple
filling even I used 4 small apples. The dough rolls better if you make it
right on the parchment paper you are going to bake it. Other than that it came
out delicious. Thanks Julia!! Canada is cool.

alcohol from rum is evaporated in the oven and only the aroma remains so that
it can be used even when cooking for children but if I’m not at home, I don’t
think the taste changes a lot, so it’s possible without rum🥰❤️💋

Hi Julia, I’m very much a newbie at this baking game haha, and don’t have the
luxury of a stand mixer or the worktop space for one (London kitchen sizes are
naff unless you earn a fortune! So going to cheat a little first with some
shop-bought dough! The recipe is making my mouth water already but I’m
‘confused.com’ about the rolling up and the six-inch strip, as to which
direction the filling is laid out and then rolled. Any chance of a pic with
the ingredients on before rolling up and another being rolled? Or am I being
thick here??  
So I’m going to try a good old English apple pie first (just like ‘mum used to
make’ -sounds better with Italian ‘Mama’!). Her family owned a cafe/restaurant
so she grew up a dab hand at classic English cooking, mains and desserts (or
dinner and ‘afters’ as we called them then) But the rum-soaked raisins are
going in! And I’m hoping when I get around to the Apfel Strudel that it will
conjure up long-forgotten tastes and smells, from Austrian tea rooms in the
ski holidays of my youth.

Hi,  
What kind of apples do you think is best for this strudel?
Thanks in advance.

January 25, 2021 at 12:58 pm
You can use any kind of apple but a tart apple with a bit of sweetness works
best similar to what you would use for apple pie. Jonagold, Golden Delicious,
Granny Smith, Honeycrisp, or a combination of these would work great.

I haven’t tried that so I’m not sure. I think the apple filling would soak
through the dough overnight and then it wouldn’t crisp up when baking the next
morning.

You measure 1/4 cup of the cold, solid butter and then melt it in a pan or the

I haven’t tried it so I can’t say for sure. But I think it would make it more
difficult to roll out and stretch the dough.

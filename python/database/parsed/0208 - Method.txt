Instructions
Pat the shredded sweet potato dry to remove any excess water (if needed) and combine with the arrowroot starch, coconut oil, and salt and pepper. Stir until fully incorporated.
Preheat your waffle iron to medium-low heat and grease well. Use a spatula or large ladle to scoop half of the sweet potato mixture onto the waffle iron (I use a 10â€³ waffle iron) and press down to evenly flatten. Close the waffle iron and cook for 4-5 minutes.
Once crisp, carefully use tongs to remove the waffle and set it aside. Repeat with the other half of the sweet potato.
Serve warm topped with toppings of your choice, or as a side at breakfast.

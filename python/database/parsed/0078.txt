The Healthy Recipe
Health and nutrition news that’s easy to digest… 
Winter Squash, Thick Skin, Warts, Weird or Scary but Don’t Be Afraid of this Flavor Packed Nutritional Powerhouse
Autumn is the perfect time of year to try Winter Squash. Unlike the varieties of squash that are available throughout the summer, Winter Squash is known for its hard shell and odd shape. Whether shopping at a Farmer's Market or the grocery store, it's hard to miss the weird shaped vegetables that are now available in abundance. 
At the Fall Market: Squash, Apples and Blue Pumpkins?
The rich colors of autumn are captured in the gorgeous produce that is available at fall farmers markets across the country. Delicious fruits and vegetables such as pumpkins, squash, apples, pears, plums, corn and sweet potatoes are coming into season.

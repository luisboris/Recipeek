You guys!!! We’re bringing back a breakfast “meal prep” favorite! G luten free no bake protein breakfast bites! Yep, these bites have been given a little makeover and an update, just for this post. And why I am republishing it today.
The truth is, I have been working on rewriting both of my Healthy Bites ebooks (aka no bake energy and protein balls). My first ebook was created in Spring 2009! That’s almost a decade ago. Whoa! _I figured it might be time to update and upgrade. _These healthy bites recipes include a ton of food allergy friendly options; vegan , paleo, nut free, no sugar, and just plain gluten-free protein bite options. All no-bake, of course. We’re-testing the recipes, tweaking the ingredients, etc. Phew, we’re ALMOST DONE!
That being said, I’m excited to share one of my VERY FAVORITE no bake protein breakfast bite recipes from the first ebook and now one of the MOST POPULAR on pinterest.

Ingredients to make NO BAKE BREAKFAST BITES
Cinnamon (lots)
Gluten Free Oats or your favorite gluten free or grain free cereal
Nut Butter or Sunflower seed butter
Honey or Maple Syrup
Vanilla
Vanilla Protein powder or peanut flour (Collagen protein or egg white protein also works for those looking for a paleo option)
Almond flour
Need nut substitutes? Don’t you worry, I have that covered in the recipe notes below!
HOW TO MAKE CINNAMON VANILLA PROTEIN BREAKFAST BITES
Simple, grab your favorite vanilla protein powder, combine it with your favorite gluten free cereal/oats, and then roll it all together with cinnamon and nut butter. OR you can blend it all together (minus the honey) in a food processor then transfer that batter into a large bowl and add honey. Mix and roll!
12] ![][13]
In the video below (sorry it’s an oldie but goodie), you will see I have several options for the gluten free cereal base. Oats, rice crisps, gluten free Chex cereal, banana chips, etc. Whatever works, as long as you get a good base “meal/flour.” You can do that by using gluten free oats or by grinding up your cereal/granola. See above.
Either way, then end result is a batch of extremely delicious breakfast bites! Similar to taste to that of a cinnamon bun.. okay not really, more like a snickerdoodle meets oatmeal cookie. Still good for breakfast, in my opinion.

Let me know what you think of the video or if you have any questions about these no-bake breakfast protein bites! There are lots of easy substitutes if need be. Oh and be sure to use a CREAMY nut butter that stirs easy. That’s crucial! 
Now, let’s continue this whole breakfast with protein talk…
How can I get protein for breakfast (other than eggs)?
It’s important that all of us eat a good amount of breakfast protein – it helps to kickstart the body into action for the day. The thing is, not everyone likes or can eat eggs, so I like to have options to offer for good egg-free sources of protein for breakfast. Obviously, the Cinnamon Vanilla Breakfast Protein bites are a high-protein source, but here are a few more high-protein breakfast ideas:
Non-soy protein powder – I like to add it to smoothies. Try my Creamy Coconut Spirulina Superfood Smoothie or Orange Probiotic Immunity Boosting Smoothies.
Quinoa – It’s super delicious anytime, but one of my favorite ways to eat quinoa is in this Creamy Vegan Pumpkin Quinoa Breakfast.
Nut butter – Peanut butter, almond, cashew, walnut – choose your favorite! Load it up onto apple slices, schmear it onto gluten-free toast, or make these Dark Chocolate Almond Butter Breakfast Cookies.
Alright, I think we are fully ready to tackle a protein rich breakfast! Ready to make and NO BAKE?
Cinnamon Vanilla No Bake Protein Breakfast Bites
Gluten free, vegan friendly, and seriously so good for breakfast on the go or post workout protein snacking!

Description
These Cinnamon Vanilla Protein Breakfast Bites are super easy to make, with NO BAKING required! Healthy, great for snacks or breakfast on the go. Kid-friendly. gluten-free, and vegan-friendly!
Ingredients
Scale 1x2x3x
3/4 cup of gluten free rolled oats or gluten free cereal of choice
1/4 cup (around 65–75 grams) Vanilla Protein Powder (see notes for substitutes)
1/2 cup almond flour or more oat flour if can’t have nuts. (You can also just finely grind raw almonds) ·
1 heaping tablespoon ground Cinnamon (extra for coating)
1/4 to 1/3 cup nut butter or sunflower seed butter (creamy no stir works best)
1/2 tsp to 1 tsp Vanilla extract
1/4 to 1/3 cup maple syrup or honey if you are not vegan.·
Instructions
1. Grind up your oats or cereal in a food processor and transfer into a mixing bowl. This is optional. You can keep them whole as well and adjust the addition of honey.
2. Add your almond meal, protein powder, cinnamon, and nut butter. Stir ingredients all together. 
1. Alternatively (you can blend all at once by placing ingredients (minus the honey) in the food processor or blender and blend until a mealy batter is formed. Scrap sides and transfer to bowl (see blog post pictures).
3. Add in your honey and vanilla then mix again well with hands.
4. You might need to add more honey or nut butter if the batter gets to dry. (see notes)
5. Roll into 1-1.5 inch balls and place on a cookie tray or plastic ware with parchment paper underneath.
6. Let them freeze for 20-30 minutes then transfer into a Ziploc bag.
7. Dust with additional cinnamon and vanilla protein if desired.
8. Keep in fridge or freezer for up to 6 weeks.
Notes
Don’t have protein powder? You can substitute with peanut flour or Oat flour (but will need to add a little vanilla) or if you would prefer a paleo friendly protein, then Egg white protein or Collagen Protein Powder will do the trick!
You might need to add more honey or nut butter if the batter gets to dry. It depends on the types of protein and flour you use, adjust as you mix, before rolling.

gobi paratha recipe | gobi ka paratha | gobhi paratha recipe with step by step photo and video recipe. basically a north indian or punjabi cuisine parantha recipe that is stuffed with flavoured grated cauliflower. the bread is prepared with whole wheat flour dough to which spiced grated gobi mixture is stuffed. moreover, there are several recipes for gobhi parantha which mainly differs in its stuffing.
i have posted several paratha recipe till now but this simple gobi paratha recipe was long due. i think i overlooked to and i assumed that i had already posted this recipe. moreover i started getting several requests for this exotic indian flat bread recipe. hence i thought to post this recipe quickly on my blog. in this recipe i have used only cauliflower stuffing, but this can be easily extended by adding onions, potatoes and even capsicum. perhaps i would share that recipe soon.
some important tips and suggestion for a perfect and yummy gobhi ka paratha recipe. firstly, the dough needs to be kneaded very smoothly so that the spiced cauliflower is easily stuffed. secondly, and more importantly, apply butter or ghee on paratha while frying after you have roasted the paratha once. this ensures the paratha to cook perfectly otherwise it will turn oily and half cooked. lastly, i have added red chilli powder to gobi stuffing, but additionally green chillies too can be added to make it more spicy.
finally, i would like to highlight my other paratha recipes collection and roti recipes collection with this post. especially, aloo paratha , paneer paratha , mooli parata , aloo cheese paratha , lachha paratha , methi ka thepla , tandoori roti and rumali roti recipe. in addition, i would like to highlight my other recipes collection like,

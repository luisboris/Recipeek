Kyselica_ ( _kyselice_ ) is a traditional sauerkraut soup from the historic Wallachian region in the Czech Republic. It translates as sauerkraut soup. It is a thick soup consisting of potatoes, sauerkraut and smoked meat that dates back several centuries. Kyselica has its origins in the word _kysely_ , a Czech word that means ‚Äúsour‚Äù.
Forest workers traditionally ate kyselica as a breakfast meal. It was said that the soup was so hearty that you would not need lunch. Comprising of inexpensive ingredients that were available in abundance, the nutritious soup would prepare the workers for long days in the outdoors. It was especially eaten during the winter months. 
There are many variants of the soup, and no one can claim to know what exactly the original recipe was. It is thought that the dish originated form Romania, sometime between the 14th and 17th centuries. Romanian shepherds migrated to the area and it is believed that was when the first kyselica recipe was introduced to the Czech Republic.
Originally, the soup didn‚Äôt contain meat, but over the years, various smoked meats have been added to the dish, most commonly smoked sausage and bacon.

Because kyselica dates back many centuries, there are lots of variations of this hearty soup across both the Czech Republic and Northern and Central Europe. Eggs and mushrooms are added to some of the regional variations of kyselica and caraway seeds are added to the aromatics.
In Poland, rye is a traditional ingredient, in their variant called _zur_ , or _zurek_ , and when wheat is used, it is called _barszcz bialy_ (white borscht). Across the border in Slovakia, paprika is added to the soup and this red colored soup is called _kapustnica_.
Czech cuisine has a long standing tradition of soups. Along with kyselica, other popular soups include _kyselo_ and _kulajda_. Kyselo is made from sourdough and has a mushroom base. Kulajda is made with potatoes, cream and mushrooms and uses vinegar and dill as its aromatics.
Sauerkraut is a finely cut cabbage that has been fermented by lactic acid. Fermenting the cabbage means that it has a long shelf life and it has a distinctive sour taste. Sauerkraut is a German word translates to ‚Äúsour herb‚Äù or ‚Äúsour cabbage‚Äù. The process of making sauerkraut is similar to how kimchi is made. Cabbage is finely shredded, layered with salt and stored for a minimum of three days. The natural juices released from the cabbage cause the fermentation process. Sauerkraut is more nutritious than the original cabbage, it is rich in vitamins B, C and K, is low in calories and is a good source of calcium, magnesium and dietary fibers. Sauerkraut is a popular ingredient across northern and central Europe, including Germany, Poland and Ukraine.
Kyselica is prepared in a similar way to other soups. The base ingredients (in this case the potatoes and sauerkraut) are boiled together until soft, and the onions and meats are fried until cooked through. The meat and onion are combined with the potato and sauerkraut and cooked together. Sour cream is stirred in once the soup is ready to create a creamy texture. Like other soups, large batches can be made at a time and refrigerated in an air tight container for three or four days. Alternatively, portions can be frozen and then reheated as required.
Kyselica is served as a main meal and often accompanied with fresh bread such as sourdough. In restaurants, smaller portions can be served as an appetizer. In modern times, it is sometimes served in a bread bowl. Kyselica is a thick and creamy soup with a slight sour taste to it, which comes from the sauerkraut base.

This looks really delicious and I can‚Äôt wait to cook this at home tonight for the fam, but I‚Äôm not sure what ‚Äúwhole allspice berries‚Äù are, is it a common food item to find at the store (say Safeway?). If I can‚Äôt find it, will allspice be an okay substitute? Thanks for sharing!

Two questions: 
Do you drain the sauerkraut first? 
Is 3/4 cup water really enough to boil the potatoes?

Hey Cathy, yes, the sauerkraut should be drained. Also, the potatoes are diced, so yes, 3/4 cup of water should be enough, and they can steam too. Enjoy!

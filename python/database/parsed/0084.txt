Irish Soda Bread
By Lauren Miyashiro
Mar 4, 2020 
Though the dough for this recipe is rather traditional, how we serve it (with chocolate üòÖ) is not. We messed with tradition and replaced the currants with mini chocolate chips. This upset a lot of our fans on Facebook. Because apparently, not even currants are authentic. Traditional Irish soda bread has no mix-ins. 
If you want to bake up a classic loaf, skip the mini chocolate chips and don't sprinkle extra sugar on top. Personally, we really love our sweeter, chocolatey version, but a plain slice served warm with salty Irish butter is just as amazing. 
Looking for more classic Irish fare? Check out our corned beef & cabbage recipe!

Directions
1. Preheat oven to 375¬∫. Grease an ovenproof 10‚Äù skillet with cooking spray and line the bottom with parchment paper. 
2. In a medium bowl, whisk together flour, ¬º cup sugar, baking soda and salt. Using a pastry cutter, or your hands, work in the butter until it‚Äôs evenly incorporated. 
3. In a separate medium bowl, combine buttermilk and egg. Add to the dry ingredients and stir until just combined. Do not over mix! Fold in chocolate chips, raisins, or currents, if using. 
4. Place dough in skillet and score an ‚ÄúX‚Äù on top with a sharp knife. Brush with melted butter and sprinkle with remaining sugar, if using. Bake until golden, or until a toothpick comes out clean, 45 to 55 minutes. When you tap the loaf, it should sound hollow. Cool at least 10 minutes before slicing and serving.

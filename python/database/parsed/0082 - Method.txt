Instructions
1. Preheat oven to 375Â°F. Line a rimmed 12in x 18in baking sheet with foil or even better, parchment paper.
2. Thoroughly wash the potatoes & carrots with a scrubber and cut them in smaller pieces. Pat dry with a paper towel.
3. Pat dry chicken with a paper towel.
4. Add chicken, potatoes and carrots, onion & garlic to the lined rimmed baking dish and sprinkle with 1 Tbsp salt, 1 tsp ground pepper, and 4 tsp garlic. Drizzle with 3-4 tbsp olive oil. Carefully toss everything to coat.
5. Place in the oven and bake chicken and potatoes for 1 hour 20 minutes. Check for doneness -if the potatoes and chicken thighs are soft and easily pierced with the fork they are ready.
6. If the chicken and potatoes have not browned up as much as you would like, turn the broil setting on and broil for 5 minutes. Watch carefully, or they will burn.
7. Remove from the oven and serve right away in the baking pan or transfer to a warm serving plate.

methi thepla recipe | methi ka thepla recipe | methi na thepla recipe with step by step photo and video recipe. basically a roti recipe from gujarati cuisine, but very well popular all over india. thepla has a longer shelf life compared to normal roti‚Äôs and can be easily preserved for 3 days in room temperature. it is prepared very similar to methi paratha recipe, however besan or gram flour is added to make it soft.
while the fenugreek leaves are considered to be bitter in taste, it has several heath benefits to offer especially with methi thepla recipe. firstly, it helps in improving digestion and appetite. it is full of antioxidants and fibre, which eventually removes all toxins from our body. secondly, fenugreek leaves helps in reducing body weight and can be easily included in diet for weight watchers. it is also considered to be good remedy for menstrual disorders especially the pain and the cramps. lastly, it also helps to cure hair loss disorder and helps to retain the glow on skin.
besides, some important tips and suggestion for a perfect methi thepla recipe. firstly, soak the fenugreek leaves in warm water for minimum of 15 minutes. this ensures to reduce the bitterness taste of fenugreek leaves. thepla has to be fried on medium to high flame and not on low flame. on low flame the thepla would turn hard and brittle. adding curd is optional while kneading the dough. however curd helps to make thepla soft, but skip it if you are vegan. lastly, do not forget to add ajwain or carrom seeds which help in digestion of gram flour.

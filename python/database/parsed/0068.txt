Buckwheat and Beef Pilaf (Plov)

This buckwheat and beef pilaf is a play on traditional rice plov, but I think I like it even more! The meat is fall-apart tender and you’ll be running to refill your plate.
This dish is hearty, flavorful, and a must try. Using toasted buckwheat makes it so much healthier than white rice and adds a nice nuttiness. Buckwheat plov was my husband’s creative genius. Vadim, I just wish you had thought of it sooner! 😉 Also, it pairs well with pickles; sold.
You may use a variety of beef for this recipe, but you do want some marbeling/fat in the meat for best results. The meat in the photograph below is a chuck roast that I purchased at Costco – I trimmed quite a bit of the fat off.
Ingredients for Buckwheat Plov:
1/3 cup olive oil 
8 Tbsp unsalted butter, divided 
1 large onion, diced 
1 to 1 1/4 lbs beef (chuck, sirloin or good quality stew meat), trimmed of extra fat and cut into 1/2″ to 3/4″ thick pieces 
3 large carrots, julienned 
2.5 cups buckwheat groats (aka grechka) 
4 1/4 cups cold filtered water + 1 cup hot water 
2 tsp salt and 1/4 tsp black pepper, or to taste (I use sea salt) 
1 tsp cumin spice to taste 
1 full head of unpeeled garlic
How to make Buckwheat and Beef Pilaf:
1\. Set a large heavy-bottomed stock pot or dutch oven (ours is 5 1/2 Qt) over medium/high heat and add 1/3 cup olive oil and 4 Tbsp butter. Add onion and sauté, stirring occasionally until softened (about 5 min).
2\. Add cubed beef and sauté 5 min, turning once (beef will not be fully cooked). Add julienned (click here to see the handy slicer we use) carrots and stir another minute.
3\. Add 4 1/4 cups cold water and season with 1 tsp cumin, 2 tsp salt and 1/4 tsp pepper or to taste. Bring to a boil then reduce heat to a low simmer, cover and cook 1 hour (you should hear the faint simmer when your lid is on).
4\. Meanwhile (about 10 min before your timer is up), heat a large non-stick skillet over medium/high heat and melt in 4 Tbsp butter. Add 2 1/2 cups buckwheat and toast until golden, stirring often (3-5 min). Pour buckwheat into the pot in an even layer and gently pour enough hot water to cover buckwheat 1/2″ above the level of the buckwheat (I added 1 cup hot water).
5\. Cut (using a sharp knife) garlic head in half and place over the top of buckwheat, cut-side-down, pushing down into the buckwheat slightly. Cook uncovered over medium heat until most of the liquid boils out (10 min) _._
6\. Poke 8-10 holes through the buckwheat to allow steam to escape to the surface, then cover with lid, reduce heat to the lowest setting and let pot sit another 30 minutes. Remove garlic and stir everything gently to combine. P.S. The garlic cloves are perfectly edible – you can squeeze them easily out of their skins and serve them in the pilaf if you wish.
Did I mention the meat is T-E-N-D-E-R?

Natasha – thanks for the great work you’re doing with your website! I became a much better cook (from zero, actually) – thanks to you. Question – what peeler/grater do you use for carrots? The one in this recipe looks like it’s creating a nice thin jullien. (this looks like it will be just the right cut for the Korean carrot salad (the russian/korean salad with garlic and vinegar)

Hi Betty, from what I can tell, yours are the cracked ones which cook much faster. They should be whole groats for this recipe or they will be overcooked and probably mushy.

For an additional bit of depth, I substituted 1 cup of decaf Texas pecan coffee. We learned, living overseas, that adding coffee to any pot roast, no matter how old that water buffalo was when it dropped dead, could tenderize beef like nothing else, and really added a nice depth. Decaf is simply because I am caffeine sensative.

Hi Natasha, 
I see that you said to use a heavy bottom pot or dutch oven. I have neither. Just regular pots. Would that still work? Or would I have to change the cooking time or temp? I want to make it tonight so I hope to hear from you soon. Thank! 🙂
Reply
natashaskitchen
May 31, 2017
Hi Stacey, the reason why a heavy bottom is recommended is for more even heat distribution and to reduce the risk of scorching on the bottom. I would just keep a close eye on it and make sure the pot isn’t set over too high of heat.

I made this a couple of days ago. With half the amount of meat, i added half a leek- in with the carrots- because i needed to finish it & some broccoli- in with the garlic (I’m big on my veggies, can you tell..). I only had green buckwheat so i skipped the last cup of water (they can get quit mushy).
It came out very nice- applause and hats off all around. 
Next time I’m going to put more onions- maybe even caramelize them separately and serve on top, less garlic but peel them off & quarter them.
Thanks for a great meal idea, very versatile, healthy, delicious and easy.

Kind of URGENT comment…so what If I completely missed the part where you have to cook the meat separately for an hour before adding buckwheat? I added the seared meat with the raw buckwheat and poured water over it? Is 30 min enough to cook the meat? Or am I doomed? Lol

You are not doomed. 🙂 The meat just will not be as tender, but the overall dish should still taste good. I think you would like it better if the meat was cooked longer, but it should still taste great!

Hi Natasha,
How are you?
I made this recipe last night, and my buckwheat came out like mush. I did add a little extra onion and a little bit extra meat, and added a little bit less water than what is needed from recipe. Maybe that didn’t help…otherwise, the rest of your ingredients/procedures, I followed. If I were to make this recipe again, any thoughts on how to cook buckwheat without making it like mush. Or, maybe it is supposed to be this way? Also, even when I added a bit more meat, the proportions is still off to me, there is still too much buckwheat vs meat. I like my dishes meaty! 🙂
Reply
natashaskitchen
February 6, 2017
Hi Anna, it really depends on where you get your buckwheat. It isn’t supposed to be mushy but the grains are individual as shown in the photos. With good buckwheat, even if you get your proportions off slightly with water, it shouldn’t turn to mush. I always purchase mine at a European/Russian store. The second best place is whole foods. You can also find it on Amazon (I buy this exact brand at the local European store). I’ve purchased it at Winco before and it was terrible from there and turned to mush. Where did you buy the buckwheat?
Reply
Anna
February 7, 2017
Thank you for sharing the link of the groats that you use. I did not realize that brand makes a difference on the quality and how the buckwheat cooks, even if it is a whole grain kernel. I used Wolff’s Whole Buckwheat Groats that I bought at a local Shoprite. Unfortunately, the closest European/Russian food store (that I am aware of) is about an hour from where I live. 🙁 I do have a bag of some Russian brand buckwheat/whole kernels from a recent trip to Netcost. So, I do plan to try this recipe again. Especially, that my husband, son and I enjoyed the flavors of this recipe, regardless how mushy. Thank you for your thoughts and delicious recipes!

Hi Lana, I always give credit where credit is due. He got the inspiration for this recipe from a Russian cookbook and we combined it with our own plov recipe to come up with it. My husband doesn’t read through all the comments as we get sometimes more than 200 comments a week. If the recipe was from you, I definitely would have given you credit. I do appreciate when readers share creative ideas and I have even shared several reader recipes on my blog which have become family favorites (always crediting).

I just found it interesting that you commented back that it was a great idea to make buckwheat plov and all of a sudden your husband came up with the idea a few months later. I wouldn’t be the one taking credit for it anyway, my mom came up with it many years ago and I was just excited to share the idea with you since you asked for other ways to enjoy buckwheat. I’m glad you figured out a recipe you like. I’m sure other people have figured out that replacing almost any rice dish with buckwheat is easy and tastes great with a few adjustments. Best of luck to you and I look forward to trying some of your other recipes.

How would I cook the chicken breast or things instead of beef for this recipe? Less time, maybe water? Or any other suggestions? And if I have Russian grechka, do I still need to toast? No washing?

Hi Tanya, I used a Russian buckwheat and I still toasted it. You usually don’t have to wash it unless you get it out of a bin. If it was packaged, you should be fine without rinsing :). The cook time with the chicken should be less. Cook it until it is tender. I always make this with beef so I don’t know exactly how long with chicken. I do think chicken thighs would be better and more tender than chicken breast 🙂

How far expired is it? If it’s pretty recent and it’s an unopened bag it may still be fine I would use the sniff test and if it smells rancid or old, discard it. Also, Amazon actually sells Russian buckwheat which I think is superior to what is in American supermarkets because it doesn’t get mushy.

I cooked this for my family. It was good, meat was tender, however, I think that a stick of butter kind of cancels out the healthiness in this dish. I will definitely cut back on butter next time. Also, I want to try searing the meat first without onions, because I think the onions get in the way of meat getting a good sear. Unless I did something wrong:) Anyway, thanx for recipe.

Hi Alena, Plov is traditionally made with even more oil and butter. I actually used less than normal, but I’m also a butter lovin’ kinda gal ;). The searing isn’t as important (it doesn’t have to be a perfect “sear”) because the meat becomes tender with the long cooking time. I’ve used a little more meat in the past and it became juicy instead of searing and it still turned out great and very tender.

Hey Natasha do you think it would be okay if the carrots were grated instead of julienned?

Irina, grated carrots are fine, you can also thinly slice them. Let me know how it turns out :).

Hi! This sounds delicious! Do you think I can use chicken thighs instead of beef? How do you think that will taste?

This looks really good and autumn appropriate. I guess I need to buy the garlic, though. I grow it in my garden but it will be mission impossible to make it that clean.

Yum. I make a similar thing but with a few diced tomatoes through it. Love your website. Great to find reliable Russian recipes. (I’ve got a Russian husband) I’ve tried a few from Russian websites but the recipes always seem to be off and quite end in disaster!

That is a wonderful compliment and thank you so much Sophie! We do try very hard to be clear and precise with our instructions, ingredients and photos. It’s a painstaking process but it’s how we would want to find recipes so that is how we provide them. I know exactly what you’re talking about! 😉

Hey Natasha! Do you have any video tutorials showing how you use the mandolin slicer?? Seems like I’ve seen it on here before? I bought one (different brand than yours) and I tried to use it when making borsch and almost hurt myself bad lol! Don’t know if I just bought a bad one or if my technique is wrong?! The carrots are so hard- I had very difficult time trying to push it down to shred it..!

Hi Lindsey :). Always use gloves – we purchased these no No Cry brand gloves on Amazon and they absolutely save your hands. They are great for mandolin slicing, grating, and using the matchstick slicer.

Last night I made a plan to make your buckwheat and ground pork one pot recipe tonight but then I saw your newest post just in time to get a nice piece of beef at the store instead! I love plov but don’t enjoy eating rice very often so this is a perfect take on it, especially because I love buckwheat even more!! Plus it’s so easy to make! It’s simmering now and smells fantastic…can’t wait until it’s ready! Thanks Natasha!

can you use ‘instant’ kasha ( the one that comes in perforated boil bags for this? It may save some time. I love kasha and I love Plov. can’t wait to make this, but I will probably try it with lamb instead of beef. like the idea of using a whole garlic cut in half too.

I don’t really have any experience with instant kasha – I usually just buy the regular buckwheat so I’m not sure how it converts as far as how much water you need for the amount of buckwheat. I imagine you wouldn’t want to cook it as long with instant buckwheat or it would probably get mushy.

instant’ kasha cooks fairly quickly (less than 10 minutes if even that) and just absorbs the cooking water. You can tell it’s done when it’s fat and soft. Because the plov has so much liquid already, just tossing it in dry should absorb the liquid and you can also skip sauteeing the kasha before you add it to the pot.

What a brilliant idea! Kudos to Vadim for thinking it up. 🙂 I don’t think I can ever get tired of buckwheat and the more ways to eat it the better. I’ve been sitting on a buckwheat recipe idea for a while myself but still haven’t managed to flesh it out. I am now inspired!

Instructions
In the Instant Pot, sauté the onion and celery on the Sauté setting until soft. Add a small amount of water to loosen vegetables if they begin to stick.
Add the garlic and sauté 1 or two more minutes. Stir in the tomato paste and cook for 1 minute.
Add the carrots, potatoes, veggie broth, red lentils, and the seasonings. Cook in the Instant Pot on manual setting for 10 minutes with a natural pressure release.
When the pressure has come down, remove the lid and stir in the peas. Replace the lid and leave the pot on the “Keep Warm” setting for approximately 5 minutes or until the peas are cooked.

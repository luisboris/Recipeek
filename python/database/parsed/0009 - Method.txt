METHOD
1. Prepare the galette dough. Pulse the ingredients together in a food processor (I prefer to work the dough with my hands). Add more cold water a little a bit at a time if the dough feels dry. Flatten and fold the dough before wrapping it to set. Refrigerate for 30 minutes.
2. Preheat oven 200°C /392°F. Prepare the filling. Mix blueberries, cornstarch, and muscovado sugar together. When using fresh wild berries the given 1,5 tbsp of cornstarch is enough. If using frozen wild blueberries, use them straight from the freezer and add a bit more cornstarch.
3. Shape the galette. Place it on a piece of parchment paper and work the dough with a rolling pin. Leave 3cm of the border around the edge. When ready, transfer it on a baking tray.
4. Add the blueberry mix in the middle of the galette. Fold the edges in and give finishing touches by brushing the edges with whisked egg and drizzle some caster sugar on top.
5. Bake for 25-30 minutes in the middle rack until the bottom is ready. Transfer the galette to a wire rack to cool. I prefer to serve this warm with vanilla ice cream, but you can also let it cool completely.

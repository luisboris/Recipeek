Instructions
1. Preheat the oven to 190C / 375F and line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
2. Heat the 1 tablespoon olive oil in a frying pan on medium low heat. Add the leeks and saute for 5 minutes or until they begin to soften. Add the garlic and green onions and cook for another few minutes until they too soften.
3. Next add the thawed spinach, dill, rosemary, salt and pepper. If you're using the vegan feta, now is the time to add it. 
4. Continue to cook this mixture for a few minutes to allow any residual moisture to evaporate. Taste and adjust seasoning as necessary.
5. At this point the filling can be set aside or used right away. To make the triangles take one sheet of filo and brush it lightly with some olive oil. Lay another layer of dough on top and bush it lightly with olive oil. Finally add a the last layer of filo, and brush it lightly with oil (this makes three layers total).
6. Take the three layered piece of filo and cut it into 4 strips along the long edge. Working quickly (so the filo doesn't dry out too much) add around 3 tablespoons of spinach filling to one strip and begin to fold up like a triangle. If you're having trouble with the folding see the video above.
7. Continue in this manner until all the filling is used. Once you have around 12 triangles, brush them one more time with a little olive oil and sprinkle with sesame seeds. 
8. Bake for 25-30 minutes or until golden and crisp. Serve warm.

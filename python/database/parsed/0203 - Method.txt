That said, let’s start
Step 1) – Bring the water to a boil with 1 tablespoon of coarse salt. When the water is startig boiling, pour in the corn flour slowly and little by little. Stir constantly and at the beginning mix with a hand whisk: it helps not to form lumps.
Step 2) – At first polenta has a very watery consistency then, little by little, you see that it begins to thicken and solidify. Never stop stirring while pouring the flour. The trick is to pour in the flour slowly while mixing quickly.
Step 3) – Then lower the heat to low. Cook the polenta without ever stopping stirring, always in the same direction, with a long-handled wooden spoon, so that the mixture does not stick to the bottom of the pot.
Step 4) – Cook the polenta for about 40-60 minutes, the time depends on the grinding of the corn flour and the consistency you prefer. However no less than 40 minutes. Taste the polenta to check its flavor. If it is slightly bland for your taste, add some fine salt.
After the necessary cooking time, TURN UP the heat so that it detaches well from the bottom and sides of the pot. If the polenta tends to dry out too much while it cooks, you can add a ladle of boiling salted water. If it is too soft, leave it on the stove for a few more minutes.
Step 5) – Once cooked, pour the polenta on a wooden cutting board if its consistency is hard and firm, as in our recipe. If you prefer a soft creamy polenta, then pour it in a serving bowl. Serve hot.

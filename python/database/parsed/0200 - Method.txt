How to Make Leek Risotto: Directions
Step 1) – First thing first make a vegetable stock: you’ll need it to cook risotto. You can make it the day before and keep it in the refrigerator. Reheat when necessary. Then clean the leeks. Remove the dark green part of the leek and the last part with the roots. Then remove even the hardest outer leaf, which you can add to the stock for more flavor.
Step 2) – Cut the leeks into rings and rinse them under fresh water to remove any earth residues.
Step 3) – In a large saucepan, pour 3 tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil and half a dose of butter. Turn on the heat and when the butter has melted, add the rings of leeks, a pinch of salt and a ladle of vegetable stock. Cook for 2 to 3 minutes.
Step 4) – Add the rice and mix well. Then add the white wine and let the it evaporate.
Step 5) – Finally add hot vegetable stock, very little at a time stirring constantly. Let it cook for about 15 minutes. At the end turn off the heat and add Parmigiano cheese and the remaining butter. Mix well for a creamy leek risotto. If you like, add some freshly ground black pepper. Serve leek risotto immediately hot with a little more grated Parmigiano cheese to taste.
Storage

Sabra Krock for The New York Times
This satisfying vegetarian dish is adapted from a recipe belonging to Julie
Sahni, the popular Indian chef, cookbook author and teacher. Its preparation
is very similar to baba ghanoush in that you roast and mash the eggplant
before seasoning it with aromatics, herbs and spices, but its flavor profile
is wildly different. Here, turmeric, garam masala and jalapeño add warmth,
while the addition of lime juice provides brightness. Serve it as a dip with
flatbread (like pita or store-bought roti), or as a main dish with rice and
raita. —Mark Bittman

Preparation
1. Prick the eggplant with a thin-blade knife. Grill over or next to very high heat, turning as necessary until the skin is blackened and the eggplant collapses. Or broil, or roast on a heated cast-iron pan in the hottest possible oven. It will take about 20 minutes.
2. When the eggplant is cool enough to handle, peel (this will be easy) and trim away the hard stem. Chop or mash in a bowl, with lime juice.
3. Heat the oil in a skillet over medium-high heat; add the onion. Cook, stirring often, until the onion is golden brown, about 10 minutes. Add the garlic and chiles and cook for another minute. Add the tomato, turmeric and salt. Cook until the tomato is soft, 5 minutes or so.
4. Stir in the eggplant purée and cook, stirring, 3 to 5 minutes. Stir in the cilantro and garam masala and turn off the heat. Serve hot with warm chapati bread or pita, or over rice.

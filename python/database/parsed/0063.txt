Peach Cobbler

Recipe by Suellen Anderson
I found this peach cobbler recipe on the internet from the Salt Lick Restaurant in Austin, TX. Everyone loves this recipe so much I have to make a double batch! Feel free to cut back on the sugar. Everyone has and the peach cobbler still comes out perfect. :D Personally, I always use two bags of frozen peaches instead of canned.

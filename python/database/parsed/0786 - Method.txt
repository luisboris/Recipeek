Instructions
Prepare the tofu marinade in a large, shallow dish. Slice the tofu into Â¼" slices and place it in the marinade so that it is completely submerged.
Marinate the tofu for at least 1 hour.
Combine the ingredients for the pickled vegetables, submerging the carrots and cucumbers completely. Cover and refrigerate for 30 minutes.
Preheat the oven to 425F. Lightly brush the pizza dough with olive oil and bake on pizza stone for 12-15 minutes until lightly golden.
While the pizza crust is baking, heat the oil in a skillet and panfry the marinated tofu until darkened and crispy, about 5 minutes per side.
Whisk together the ingredients for the Creamy Banh Mi Sauce. Set aside.
Remove the crust from the oven. Cover in an even layer of sauce. Add pickled vegetables, pan-fried tofu, and remaining toppings.

Beetroot & Azuki Rice
![][2]
![][2]
‘Sekihan’ is steamed short grain glutinous rice cooked with Azuki (Red Beans).
It is traditionally prepared to celebrate special occasions in Japan, because
of its red colour which is symbolic of happiness. On the other day, I realised
that I knew one vegetable that could make absolutely everything RED. That is
Beetroot, which is not a common vegetable in Japan. I tried to cook ‘Sekihan’
with Beetroot. It didn’t turn as red as I expected, but it gradually became
very red as it cooled down. Beetroot tastes so sweet in this ‘Beetroot& Azuki
Rice’, which can be a great side dish for any main dish.
Makes

Ingredients
1 cup (180ml cup) Glutinous Rice short grain preferred  
1 cup (180ml cup) Short Grain Rice

1/4 cup Azuki (Red Beans)  
500ml Water  
1 Beetroot cut into 1cm cubes  
3/4 teaspoon Salt  
Toasted Sesame Seeds optional
Method
1. Place washed Azuki (Red Beans) and Water in a large saucepan and cook for about 30 minutes until beans are just cooked but still firm.

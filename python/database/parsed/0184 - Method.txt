1\. In a small saucepan, combine the rice, water, and salt. Set it over medium-high heat and bring to a boil. Stir with a fork, reduce the heat to low, and cover with a lid. Cook for 10 minutes, or until the rice absorbs the water and is tender. Remove the pan from the heat and let it sit, covered, for 10 minutes.
2\. Add the oil and fluff with a fork. Let cool to room temperature.
3\. In a bowl, combine the onion and vinegar; let them sit while the rice cools. Stir the onions into the cooled rice and transfer to a serving bowl.

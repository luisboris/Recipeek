Bread Panada
In a small saucepan, bring the milk to a simmer over medium heat. Remove their crusts and then cube the bread slices. 
Soak the cubed bread in boiled milk until very soft.
Process the soaked bread in a food processor to form a smooth paste. 
Store the bread panada in a covered plastic container in the refrigerator.
_Method:_ 
Soak the breadcrumbs in the milk until the milk is completely absorbed, add the salt, then mix with a wooden spoon over a good heat so as to dry it out and leave the sides of the pan clean. Turn out onto a buttered tray or dish to allow to cool.

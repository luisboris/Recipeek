Instructions
Chilling time overnight 
Resting time 30 minutes 
You will need a 6 cm-deep, 23 cm round pie pan.
Combine lamb, sundried tomato, oil, parsley, garlic and saffron in a bowl and refrigerate overnight.
The next day, make the pastry. Place lard, goose fat, butter and 250 ml (1 cup) water in a medium saucepan over medium heat and cook for 2 minutes or until fats have melted. Remove from heat.
Place flour and 1½ teaspoonsn of salt in a large bowl. Make a well in the centre and break in eggs, stirring to combine; don’t be too fussy about it. Recreate the well and pour in warm fat mixture and stir to combine, then knead until a smooth dough forms. Wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate for 30 minutes.
Preheat oven to 180°C. Place lamb mixture and potato in a bowl with 1 tablespoon of salt and mix to combine. Season with pepper. Roll out ¾ of the pastry to fit a 6 cm-deep, 23 cm round pie pan, making sure it overhangs by about 2 cm. Fill with lamb and potato mixture, pressing into the corners and base of the tin for a compact filling. Roll out remaining pastry to make a lid and squeeze edges together tightly to seal. Roll squeezed edges over so it curls inside the pan, working in circular motion to form a good solid rim of pastry. Cut a small slit in the top, then brush all over with egg mixture.
Bake in the centre of the oven for 30 minutes, then reduce oven temperature to 160°C and bake for a further 1 hour or until pastry is golden and filling is bubbling slightly. Remove from oven and rest for an hour before serving; take care when slicing as cooking juices will spill out from pastry.

How to Make Briam?
Start by slicing the vegetables. You can either use a mandoline slicer or a sharp knife to slice into round shapes. I try to pick vegetables that are similar in thickness to make a pretty Briam and for the veggies to cook evenly.
Slice the onion into half-moons as they’re easier to eat once roasted compared to whole rounds.
To a large mixing bowl, add the sliced veggies and drizzle with olive oil, add garlic, oregano, salt, and pepper. Give everything a good mix so that the veggies are well seasoned.

To an oven-proof dish (I use this baking dish – it’s my fav!) add the diced tomatoes or passata and 1/2 cup of water. Then arrange the seasoned vegetables in rows (see picture below). You can randomly lay out the veg slices if you don’t want to spend too much time arranging them.
If there’s any olive oil left in the mixing bowl, pour that over the vegetables, I would also recommend taking a brush and brushing some sauce over the veggies. Tent foil to cover the baking dish, and place in a preheated oven.

Bake at 390°F (200°C) for 30 minutes, check if the potatoes are tender, and remove the foil. Roast for 10-20 more minutes for the liquid to reduce and the vegetables get that golden brown color.

You may want to place the dish under the broiler for 5 minutes to get the veggies to crisp up a bit.
Serve with feta cheese, crusty bread, and olives.

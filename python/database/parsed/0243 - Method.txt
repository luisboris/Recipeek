Instructions
1. Grind up your oats or cereal in a food processor and transfer into a mixing bowl. This is optional. You can keep them whole as well and adjust the addition of honey.
2. Add your almond meal, protein powder, cinnamon, and nut butter. Stir ingredients all together. 
1. Alternatively (you can blend all at once by placing ingredients (minus the honey) in the food processor or blender and blend until a mealy batter is formed. Scrap sides and transfer to bowl (see blog post pictures).
3. Add in your honey and vanilla then mix again well with hands.
4. You might need to add more honey or nut butter if the batter gets to dry. (see notes)
5. Roll into 1-1.5 inch balls and place on a cookie tray or plastic ware with parchment paper underneath.
6. Let them freeze for 20-30 minutes then transfer into a Ziploc bag.
7. Dust with additional cinnamon and vanilla protein if desired.
8. Keep in fridge or freezer for up to 6 weeks.
Notes
Donâ€™t have protein powder? You can substitute with peanut flour or Oat flour (but will need to add a little vanilla) or if you would prefer a paleo friendly protein, then Egg white protein or Collagen Protein Powder will do the trick!
You might need to add more honey or nut butter if the batter gets to dry. It depends on the types of protein and flour you use, adjust as you mix, before rolling.

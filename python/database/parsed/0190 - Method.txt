Instructions
Combine yogurt with half of the mint, half of the garlic, 1/4 teaspoon salt and black pepper. Transfer to a small serving bowl. Swirl in 1 teaspoon olive oil on top and garnish with more mint.
Heat the grill or grill pan over medium-high heat. When ready oil the grates.
Toss the vegetables in a bowl with olive oil, lemon juice, remaining garlic, zaatar, 1/2 teaspoon salt and black pepper, to taste. Grill the vegetables turning occasionally, until lightly charred, about 6 to 10 minutes. Arrange on a platter with the mint yogurt sauce. Sprinkle with remaining mint.

Grilled Flank Steak with a flavorful tomato, corn and black bean salsa is an easy, summer 30-minute weeknight dish!
Grilled Flank Steak with Black Bean Salsa
In the summer we grill every chance we can! One of my favorite ways to grill meats is to top them with fresh salad or salsa. A few successful examples of this: Grilled Flank Steak with Tomatoes Red Onion and Balsamic and Grilled Chicken Bruschetta.
This steak dish has a ton of flavor! The flank steak is seasoned with cumin and garlic and grilled to perfection, then topped with a fresh black bean, corn and tomato salsa for a quick and easy weeknight meal.
This dish is dairy-free, gluten-free and takes under 30 minutes to make.
Variations and Tips:
In this Tex Mex version, the flavors can be easily tweaked to suit your familyâ€™s taste.
Make it spicy with some chopped jalapenÃµs
Sweeten it by adding some chopped pineapple
Make it whole30 by swapping the corn and beans for a simple pico de gallo.
Make ahead. Season the steak and make the salsa a day ahead, if needed.

Made this tonight and it was delicious. My salsa had a little more liquid than I would have liked so I served it on the side with a slotted spoon instead of pouring it on top. Next time I will probably seed the tomatoes as they were very ripe and juicy. I also added half of an avocado which added some creaminess. So good! My family loved it. Ginaâ€™s recipes are the best. I make them at least 5 days a week.

Wow this was simple to make and so tasty! We had it with some multigrain tortilla chips. Everyone loved it and definitely going into rotation. I used leftover corn from the cob and it worked well.

Sounds easy & looks tasty, but Iâ€™m not at all familiar with Flank Steak. Is it anything like Skirt Steak or Flat Iron Steak? Is it a fairly tender & juicy cut of beef? Please donâ€™t laugh at my question, since Iâ€™m only familiar with â€˜Steakâ€™ cuts like: Sirloin, Porter House, T-Bone, & New York Strip Steak, aka Strip Steak. Iâ€™d like to give this recipe a try.
Pam â€” June 16, 2021 @ 12:38 pm Reply
It is a great piece of steak if cooked no more than medium. It tends to get tough if cooked longer. The sear is also really important and be sure to cut it against the grain. 
stacy â€” June 17, 2021 @ 3:29 pm Reply
Flank Steak comes out extremely tender if cooked properly. It can get tough if over cooked. I have only ever used it in stir fries but Iâ€™m looking forward to trying it out with this recipe.

Hi, 
I am doing Weight Watchers Blue program and have noticed a lot of the recipes donâ€™t add up points wise to the weight watchers calculator. Can you tell me how you calculate the points? Usually ST is about 2 points less then the WW calculator. Thanks!
Alison â€” January 26, 2021 @ 7:00 pm Reply
I figured out if I use ingredients it is the same. I was using nutritional info for a quicker input. sorry!
13. Katie C. â€” September 8, 2020 @ 7:11 pm Reply
Made the salad part of this tonight. Paired with leftover balsamic chicken which sounds odd but actually went together well. I didnâ€™t really measure because, no way was I just going to use part of a can of beans. Home grown tomatoes in peak season with a couple of corn ears. I used all the ingredients and just sort of made it by visual color. Yum!
This one is a keeper

Made this tonite for dinner. Easy to make and delicious. Had skirt steak on hand in the freezer so used that. A little higher in tsp but but worth it â€“ I love skirt steak on the grill. Definitely going to be a staple during the summer bbq season! And the black beans, corn and tomatoes are a great side with so many other recipes.

I made this for dinner tonight after seeing on your weekly meal plan this morning. My husband loved it as much as I did, and my 8-year old son really enjoyed the flank steak (huge win for the parents of a picky eater). Our outdoor grill didnâ€™t have propane so I broiled the steak on high in our oven for 8 minutes on each side for a perfect medium rare.
Iâ€™ve been a fan, and regularly check out and use your recipes, for about two years (I have both cookbooks!) but I started Weight Watchers last week and will be relying on your amazing ideas even more now. Thanks for all you do and for sharing with us!

Pretty good. Not up to par with some of your other awesome recipes, in my opinion, but fairly easy to make and it wasn't bad. I didn't much care for the black beans/tomatoes/corn mix. I think it would have been better heated instead of cold, but that's just me.

I always warm up the beans and corn, then toss the salad together. I'm not a fan of cold corn myself.

Do you thaw the frozen corn or put it on the grill? Just wondering how you aren't left chomping on frozen corn kernels.

I have an old recipe for this salad which calls for marinating overnight. Planning to serve it over grilled sirloin patties with a slice of red onion on top of the meat. Sliced avocado on a green salad would round things out nicely.

This recipe is perfect in so many ways! It's easy, inexpensive, quick, and extremely tasty. I have already recommended this recipe to a bunch of people. My only comment is on the flank steak cooking time. I used my outdoor gas grill set on high heat to cook the steak, but it only took a total of 7 minutes (3 1/2 minutes each side) and not the 6 to 8 minutes on each side. The steak turned out perfect with the 5 minute rest time under foil. Thank you for making me look like a pro.

Looks delicious! I'm always looking for new flank steak recipes as well, and I think this one might have to go on the rotation. Have you tried other veggies for relish? I love the idea, but I'm trying to cut out carbs in my recipes and wondering about ideas for subbing out the corn/tomato.

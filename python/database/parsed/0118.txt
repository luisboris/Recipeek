Spiced Apple Hand Pies (whole-wheat)
February 19, 2020PastriesHaley HansenComment
‚ÄòTis the season for the classic American dessert - apple pie. But, let‚Äôs simplify it and make it a little cuter this year with these Spiced Apple Hand Pies! The same tender, flaky crust we know and love envelops the season‚Äôs juiciest and sweetest apples with just the right amount of warm spices._
I‚Äôm always a bit confused and a little flustered around apple season - when does it begin? how long does it last? why does it feel so darn short every year? It‚Äôs like I‚Äôm always catching the tail end of it juiciness and then trying to scrape up the apples that remain to make all sorts of apple-y treats. Worth it, yes of course. Stressful, just a wee bit, because then once I‚Äôve selected my apples and brought them home, immediately, Dad‚Äôs gotta‚Äô have his apple pie.
For those of you who know my dad, you know his love for apple pie (and also his‚Ä¶ umm‚Ä¶ very specific and high standards for the classic dessert). For those of you who know me, you know my love for Dad and baking (and my tendency to strive to please and meet every standard). So, I brought these apples home along with quite a bit of pressure, most of which was self-imposed, but still worth mentioning.
I‚Äôve made an apple pie before, but that was long ago before my baking experience expanded to where it is now. Back then, I had some more wiggle room (on my resum√©, basically) that would excuse an imperfect apple pie. Back then, I also probably would have tried to make the pie crust vegan or something and convince myself that Dad wouldn‚Äôt know the difference. I‚Äôve come a long way, my friends. I can still appreciate vegan goodies, but I do now know that butter is an essential component of a good, classic pie crust. Dad‚Äôs pretty happy that I‚Äôve reached this point.
What Dad wants, Dad gets (in moderation).
You see, now that I‚Äôm catching the tail-end of apple season (as per usual) and have very little, if any, wiggle room for imperfection in a pie crust (because the crust is kind of a big deal), it seemed to make sense to me that I could avoid the risk of an imperfect classic crust altogether and potentially even surpass Dad‚Äôs expectations of a homemade full-size pie by recreating it into smaller, still homemade hand pie versions. Yes, I realize that when you do the math, it‚Äôs still mostly about the crust even in the hand pie form - after all, the crust is all you see until you cut inside to reveal the juicy, sweet, spiced apple filling.
What you must remember is that I‚Äôm not great at math, so this equation made total sense to me and actually brought me much more confidence than the idea of making a whole pie. I‚Äôm shaking my head, too.
BUT. GUESS WHAT. Dad loves them! So did Mom and so do I, but similar to the importance of the crust in the pie is the impact of Dad‚Äôs opinion on my overall satisfaction with my pie work. Go ahead, say it - Daddy‚Äôs girl.
Apple season is quickly coming to a close, so don‚Äôt waste too much time waiting for a full-size pie to bake all the way through in the oven. Make your loved ones just as happy - if not even happier! - with adorable and delicious mini apple pies. Don‚Äôt let homemade pie crust intimidate you! Let it excite you. Let it challenge you and take your baking skills to a whole new level of greatness where your loved ones will be lost for words as they eat one, two, maybe even three cute little apple pie babies.
NOTES:_
Turbinado sugar is also known as raw cane sugar. It‚Äôs a tan-colored granule larger slightly than brown sugar, so it lends a bit of a different texture than finely granulated cane sugar. If you prefer that texture, cane sugar or coconut sugar will work instead._
When making a pie crust, the importance of not over-kneading cannot be stressed enough. Once you turn the dough out onto the floured surface, you should be just about done with bringing it together. It‚Äôs going to look crumbly, but give it a few good pulls and it‚Äôll come together. This process is explained in more detail in the instructions._
RECIPE 
Makes 9-10 hand pies
For the dough: 
2 1/2 cups whole-wheat flour, plus extra for dusting 
1 teaspoon sea salt 
3 tablespoons turbinado sugar, plus extra for garnish 
1 cup cold grass-fed butter (2 sticks) 
1/3 cup ice water 
1/4 cup heavy cream, for brushing
For the apple filling: 
1 1/2 cups finely chopped apples, or about 2 medium-large apples (I used Braeburn and PinkLady) 
2 tablespoons apple cider vinegar 
2 tablespoons turbinado sugar 
2 teaspoons ground cinnamon 
1 teaspoon ground ginger 
3/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg 
1 teaspoon sea salt
For the glaze: 
1/2 cup powdered sugar 
2-3 tablespoons milk (heavy cream will also work)
1. Make the pie dough. Stir together the flour, sea salt, and turbinado sugar in a medium mixing bowl. Next, chop the cold butter into small cubes about the size of a thumbnail and add these to the flour mixture, mixing to coat the butter cubes in flour. Use your fingertips to massage the butter into the flour, smashing each cube into smaller pieces about the size of a pea. Taking the time to massage the butter into the flour will help prevent most of the gluten formation, yielding a flaky, tender crust.
2. The dough should start to come together, and now it‚Äôs time to add the water. Slowly drizzle the ice water (preventing any ice cubes from falling in) over the dough and begin pulling it together with your hands as the water moistens the flour. If the butter was massaged in well enough, 1/3 cup water should be just enough. If you need more, add it half a tablespoon at a time.
3. When all the water is added and the dough forms a shaggy lump (for lack of better terms), turn it out onto a clean and lightly floured flat surface. Form it into a ball as best you can and then use a lightly floured rolling pin to flatten the dough until about 1/2-inch thick, maintaining the round shape. Use a bench scraper or large sharp knife to cut the dough into four quadrants, then stack them on top of each other and roll out the dough again. Repeat the process 2 more times. This step is essential to create tender flaky layers. Form the dough into a rectangle about 1/2-inch thick, wrap tightly in plastic wrap, and refrigerate for at least 1 hour.
4. While the dough chills, prepare the apple filling. Make sure the apples are finely chopped - you want the cubes to be roughly the size of a fingernail, as this will allow more filling to fit into each hand pie and more of the spice mixture to coat the surface of the apples. Basically, a more finely chopped apple means more flavor penetration throughout the entire hand pie. Toss the chopped apples with the apple cider vinegar, sugar, and spices, then cover and let sit at room temperature for the remainder of the hour.
5. Preheat the oven to 400 F and line two baking sheets with parchment paper.
6. Unwrap the chilled pie dough after at least one hour and place it onto a clean and lightly floured flat surface. Carefully whack the dough a few times with the rolling pin (yes, seriously) to soften it a bit. Roll out the dough into a large rectangle about 1/8-inch thick. If you have a circle-shaped cookie stencil about 4-5 inches in diameter, use that to cut out portions of dough. Otherwise, flip a large cup with a rim about the same diameter upside down and use this to cut out portions of dough.
7. Place 2-3 tablespoons of the apple filling into the center of half of the dough cut-outs (if you have 18 cut-outs, only place the apple filling into the center of 9 of them). Dampen two fingers and lightly tap around the rim of the cut-outs with the filling on them and then place a dough cut-out on top. This small amount of moisture will help seal the bottom portion and top portions of dough when the pies bake. Gently press the rim of the covered pies with a fork to finish the seal. Repeat this process with the remaining portions of dough.
8. Lightly brush each pie before baking with heavy cream and then garnish with a sprinkle of turbinado sugar. Bake for 18-20 minutes, or until the edges are a deep golden brown color. Remove from the oven and let the pies cool on the baking sheets for 1 hour. 
9. Whisk the ingredients for the glaze in a small bowl and drizzle this over the top of each pie when they have cooled completely. Give the glaze a few minutes to set, and then serve and enjoy!
10. Store leftovers at room temperature, preferably on a plate covered loosely with plastic wrap, for up to one week (if they aren‚Äôt all eaten immediately‚Ä¶ which is doubtful).

bull;&bull;
repeat each circuit 4x, resting for 1 min after each round.

bull;&bull;
your strength, power, &amp; purpose come from within. ü§ç ItsWithinUs
bull;&bull;
i think it&rsquo;s important to lean on loved ones &amp; seek professional help when we need it. I also think it&rsquo;s important to remember that we know ourselves better than anyone else, &amp; that we are stronger than we may think! 
bull;&bull;
on the blog today, I&rsquo;ve rounded up the habits I&rsquo;ve implemented to help me stay connected to myself &amp; strong from within:
an energizing morning routine 
journaling 
intentional time alone 
positive self-talk
linked in my bio!
bull;&bull;
I&rsquo;ve been hearing lots of &ldquo;how many calories did you burn?&rdquo; talk at the gym lately. did you know that the machines are not accurate, even when the user inputs their metrics? in fact, even your fitness tracker isn&rsquo;t going to be 100% accurate at measuring calorie burn. 
bull;&bull;
most importantly, when we focus only on the calorie burn during a workout, we miss out on all of the more sustainable &amp; fulfilling reasons to exercise, like:
improved digestion &amp; metabolism 
better quality sleep
enhanced mood &amp; cognition 
FUN! 
bull;&bull;
ldquo;the way you awaken makes a world of difference&rdquo; ‚ú® YES it certainly does! I&rsquo;m such a morning person already, but I also firmly believe in making the most out of my morning to start my day off on the right foot. gratitude journal + coffee + movement are my priorities ü§ç
bull;&bull;
rounded up some of the words I&rsquo;m loving lately ‚ò∫Ô∏è‚òùüèº daily reminders, words of encouragement, little bites of inspiration - use them however you like! ‚ú®
bull;&bull;
back with another protein bite recipe because I just can&rsquo;t get enough of &lsquo;em ü•∞ 4-ingredient peanut butter protein bites! 
squeezed in a little &ldquo;me time&rdquo; at the gym this morning ‚ò∫Ô∏è it got me thinking - we don&rsquo;t always &ldquo;have&rdquo; time, but we can almost always make the time. sacrifices might be involved, but your physical &amp; mental health is important! 
bull;&bull;
there are no rules against drinking a protein shake out of a coffee mug from a brewery, right? üòÇ
bull;&bull;
my favorite chocolate-PB protein shake:
bull;&bull;
I refuse to let you forget about these Easy Salted Peanut Butter Cup Energy Bites! ‚òùüèºthey&rsquo;re getting me through a busy week of work, &amp; a stronger-than-usual craving for sweets üôÇ
bull;&bull;
bull;&bull;
last week was a very &ldquo;bleh&rdquo; week for me, so my focus this week is to just make it better üòÇ 
bull;&bull;
holy molyyyyy this 22-minute bodyweight AMRAP almost beat me this morning üòÖ but NOPE I finished it üí™üèº now it&rsquo;s your turn!
bull;&bull;
repeat each circuit AMRAP-style / 10 minutes. 
CIRCUIT 1:
toe-touch squat jumps x20
walk-out narrow push-ups x8
split squat jumps x20
push-up to plank T x8
CIRCUIT 2: 
squat jacks x20
plank shoulder tap w/ swimmers
squat jumps w/ 180 degree turn
cross-boys knee taps w/ lateral step
bull;&bull;
every form of exercise provides some form of benefit\(s\) to the body &amp; mind. we could argue all day about which is &ldquo;better&rdquo; - going back &amp; forth between this benefit &amp; that benefit. but what matters MOST is what exercise YOU enjoy ‚ò∫Ô∏è
bull;&bull;
made tater tot hot-dish today so, I think it&rsquo;s safe to say, I am OFFICIALLY a good Minnesotan. ‚ò∫Ô∏è
bull;&bull;
a 15-20 minute quad &amp; glute dumbbell only workout that will leave üî• you üî• burnin&rsquo; üî•!
bull;&bull;
perform this like a circuit if you want it more intense with a higher HR, or go with straight sets if you want to slow it down &amp; focus on strength. save the post, tag your workout buddy, &amp; get to it! ü§ìüí™üèº
bull;&bull;
5 \(sets\) x 15 \(reps\) DB RDL
5x20 DB top-loaded squats
5x15 DB sumo squats 
5x15 sumo squat pulses \(DB optional\)

Pasta alla norma (Eggplant pasta)

Pasta alla norma_ is a traditional Italian pasta with eggplant in a tomato sauce. It‚Äôs an excellent, meaty-like but vegetarian main dish that‚Äôs everything you want in a pasta ‚Äì comforting, satisfying, and slurp-worthy good!
Pasta alla norma: Eggplant pasta
When it comes to vegetables-as-the-main, eggplant rates very highly in my books because it‚Äôs _meaty_ and easy to prepare. It‚Äôs a sponge for flavour, silky and delicious in texture, good value most of the year round and extremely versatile.
This pasta is Sicilian, and as with many traditional Italian eggplant dishes, the slices are traditionally fried in a hefty amount of oil. I prefer roasting the eggplant ‚Äì it‚Äôs healthier, plus the eggplant cubes hold their shape better rather than turning into unidentifiable mush when tossed in the pasta sauce!
I like to make Pasta alla Norma using tomato passata instead of crushed tomatoes because it makes it saucier. I love how the pasta sauce clings to the pasta strands as well as the plump roasted eggplant.
Roasting the eggplant
The key to making Pasta alla Norma well is to cook the eggplant so it‚Äôs caramelised on the outside and soft inside, but mostly holds its shape when tossed in the tomato pasta sauce rather than turning into mush.
To do this, you just need salt, pepper and olive oil, and 25 minutes in a hot 240¬∞C / 450¬∞F oven to get some nice colour on the outside of the eggplant as well as creating a crust so the eggplant cubes hold their shape.
I cut the eggplant cubes a little bit smaller than when I roast eggplant cubes to serve as a simple side dish or to use in salads (like this Eggplant Lentil Salad ‚Äì it‚Äôs very, very good!). I find a slightly smaller size is more suitable for pasta ‚Äì for dispersion and how it eats.
What goes in the eggplant pasta sauce
And here are the other ingredients in Pasta alla Norma. _Basil_ is a key ingredient that really adds a fresh touch to the finished dish but if you don‚Äôt have it, don‚Äôt worry, I have solutions for you. Read on!
PS. And no, you don‚Äôt have to tie your spaghetti with a ribbon üòÇ)
Pasta ‚Äì any kind will work here except really tiny ones like risoni or those tiny alphabet or other novelty pastas. Traditionally, macaroni is used but these days it‚Äôs made with all sorts of pastas ‚Äì short (like rigatoni, penne, ziti, casarecce) and long (spaghetti, fettuccine, bucatini). I really like serving it with long pasta ‚Äì especially with the smooth pasta sauce I use in this recipe;
Tomato passata ‚Äì aka tomato puree: This is strained, plain, pureed tomato which is thick and smooth, so it‚Äôs brilliant for quick pasta sauces. Normal crushed or diced canned tomato will also work but you will need to simmer for around 20 minutes until the tomato starts to break down to create a nice thick pasta sauce. You‚Äôll find passata in the pasta section of regular supermarkets nowadays, and it doesn‚Äôt cost much more than canned tomato. _More on Tomato Passatahere;_
White wine ‚Äì optional ingredient, just a splash to add extra flavour to the sauce. Good trick for when you are making quick sauces! Any white wine that‚Äôs not too sweet or woody will do here. I use sauvignon blanc and pinot gris because that‚Äôs what I drink;
Garlic and onion (or Eschallots) ‚Äì essential for flavour base for simple pasta sauces, without which the sauce is too bland!
Italian herb mix or oregano ‚Äì to add a touch of extra flavour into this quick sauce;
Chilli flakes ‚Äì aka red pepper flakes, for a touch of warmth. 100% optional; and
Basil ‚Äì as my brother sternly told me, ‚Äúit‚Äôs not Pasta alla Norma without basil!‚Äù. Having said that though, I have made it many times using fresh thyme, which goes so well with eggplant. Also you can increase the amount of dried herbs in the pasta sauce instead and it is still 100% delicious. it‚Äôs just not true, traditional Pasta alla Norma that‚Äôs all!
Here it is with thyme instead of basil. And it‚Äôs still absolutely delicious!
How to make Pasta alla Norma pasta sauce
This is a nice quick recipe because we‚Äôre using Tomato Passata. It‚Äôs already smooth compared with crushed tomato, which needs at least 20 minutes to break down to thicken the sauce.
We start by saut√©ing the onion and garlic, add the white wine and let it simmer rapidly to cook out the harsh winey smell, leaving behind its tasty flavour base which adds an extra _something-something_ to our pasta sauce!
Then just add the Tomato Passata, dried herbs, salt and pepper and simmer for just 5 minutes. Finally, fold through the roasted eggplant, toss through pasta, throw in some basil and you‚Äôre done!
Traditionally in Sicily, Pasta alla Norma is served topped with grated _ricotta_ _sal_ _ata_ , a firm, salted version of ricotta. However ricotta salata is difficult to source outside of real Italian delis, so I use grated parmesan cheese or pecorino instead.
What to serve with Pasta alla Norma
The other great benefit of this eggplant pasta dish is that it‚Äôs loaded with a good amount of vegetables from both the tomato and eggplant, so you really don‚Äôt even need to add a side salad to supplement your daily vegetable intake! It really is a complete meal.
However, if you did want to add a side salad, a classic Italian Rocket Salad with Shaved Parmesan would be ideal. The balsamic dressing in that salad really complements the flavour in this pasta. Otherwise, put together your own salad with a Balsamic Vinegar Dressing.
For a big Italian night in, add a side of proper Italian focaccia or garlic bread. Or if you want to go _all_ the way, upgrade to _Cheesy_ Garlic Bread and finish with a classic Tiramisu. And don‚Äôt forget to invite me over for dinner! üòâ _‚Äì Nagi x_

Recipe video above. This is a traditional Italian pasta dish from Sicily, usually begun by cooking eggplant on the stove in a hefty amount of oil. I prefer roasting the eggplant ‚Äì less oil plus the eggplant holds its shape better, especially when you roast at a high temp to caramelise the surface!
Finishing with a good amount of fresh basil is traditional but even if you don't have any, there's other alternatives to add a touch of other flavour ‚Äì such as fresh thyme, or extra dried herbs in the sauce.
This is an excellent and satisfyingly "meaty" vegetarian main dish that will have even card-carrying carnivores asking for seconds!
Ingredients
CupsMetric
800g / 1.6 lb eggplant , cut into 2.5cm/1" cubes (2 medium/large ones)
2 tbsp extra virgin olive oil
1/2 tsp each salt and pepper
Pasta Sauce:
2 tbsp extra virgin olive oil
2 garlic cloves , finely minced
1/2 small onion , very finely chopped (or 2 eschallots)
1/4 cup dry white wine , anything not too sweet or woody (Note 1)
700g / 24 oz tomato passata (aka tomato puree, Note 2)
1/4 cup water
1 tsp dried Italian herbs or oregano
1/2 tsp red pepper flakes , optional (for a hint of heat)
1/2 tsp each salt and pepper
300g / 10 oz spaghetti or other pasta, long or short (macaroni, rigatoni, penne, ziti, fettucini, bucatini)
Serving:
1/2 cup basil leaves , roughly chopped (Note 3)
Parmesan cheese , grated (or ricotta salata if you have it ‚Äì more traditional)
Instructions
Roasted eggplant:
Preheat oven to 240¬∞C / 450¬∞F (220¬∞C fan). Line a tray with baking / parchment paper.
Toss eggplant with oil, salt and pepper. Spread on the tray and roast for 20 minutes.
Flip, then roast for a further 5 minutes. Cool on tray (this helps the eggplant hold its shape when tossing).
Cooking pasta:
Bring a large pot of salted water to the boil. Start cooking the pasta a couple of minutes after you start making the sauce (next section), until al dente or to your liking.
Sauce:
Heat oil in a very large skillet over medium heat. Add garlic, cook for 20 seconds until golden, then add onion and cook for 2 to 3 minutes until translucent and cooked through.
Increase heat to medium-high and add wine, if using. Let it simmer, scraping the base of the pan to deglaze, until the wine mostly evaporates.
Add tomato passata. Now pour the water into the passata bottle, screw on the lid, shake, and pour that in too (waste nothing!)
Add dried herbs, red pepper flakes, salt and pepper. Stir and simmer 5 minutes.
Stir in eggplant, then add cooked and drained pasta. GENTLY toss until pasta is coated in the sauce (so the eggplant doesn't turn into complete mush!).
Serve immediately, garnished with a good pinch of fresh basil and parmesan.
Recipe Notes:
1\. Wine ‚Äì excellent way to elevate simple quick simmer sauces like this, adds depth of flavour. You can‚Äôt taste the wine and the alcohol is cooked out. Omit if you can‚Äôt consume alcohol.
I use sauvignon blanc and pinot gris as they are my standard drinking wines. You do NOT need to use an expensive wine, you can‚Äôt tell the difference. I like to pick up bargain bottles when I see them at the liquor store for cooking purposes only. Freeze leftovers in ice cube trays then once frozen, in containers in the freezer ‚Äì for easy use going forward. 
2.Tomato passata ‚Äì pureed, strained tomatoes, sometimes labelled Tomato Puree in the US (here‚Äôs a photo of Mutti brand Tomato Passata sold at Walmart). Readily available in Australian supermarkets nowadays, alongside pasta sauces. Smooth and thick rather than chunky like canned tomato, so no need to simmer to break down the tomato.
Crushed canned tomato can be used instead, but simmer sauce for 20 minutes to soften the tomato (adjust pasta cooking time start too, accordingly).
3\. Fresh basil is a key element of traditional Pasta alla Norma. However if you don‚Äôt have it, you can compensate by adding other herby flavours such as:
1 1/2 tsp fresh thyme leaves ‚Äì this is really good, it‚Äôs my favourite when I don‚Äôt have basil!
1/2 tsp dried thyme or oregano ‚Äì extra, added into the sauce
4. Making ahead / reheating: Toss eggplant in sauce then cool and use as needed. For reheating pasta already in sauce, this pasta reheats better than most because it‚Äôs quite saucy from the Tomato Passata. Just reheat in the microwave for 2 minutes on high (for 1 serving), using water as needed to loosen.

I had an eggplant from a farm share that I needed to do something with. I used your roasted eggplant recipe. It was delicious. We just ate it like an appetizer. I must try Pasta Norma now.

I love this recipe! Thank you. It‚Äôs a perfect one for the child who loves red sauce‚Ä¶.and eats eggplant. We had this at a restaurant with mozzarella and roasted tomatoes. But this is easier for a quick meal. Mille grazie

I‚Äôm a little puzzled about the amount of protein in one serving ‚Äì where is it derived from? The most I can calculate for one serving is about 11 total grams from the eggplant, (enriched) pasta, passata, & Parmesan cheese.

This is a delicious recipe, Nagi. The second time I made it I tore fresh lasagne sheets into strips for wide pasta, I added a tablespoon of honey, and I topped it with big dollops of ricotta.

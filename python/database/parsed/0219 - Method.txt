Method
01 Put the dried fruit in a bowl and pour over the tea, mix in the sugar and stir well to dissolve. Leave to soak for at least 6 hours or overnight. 
02 Next day, sift the flour and spice into the soaked fruit (no need to drain the tea) and stir in the egg. Blend well together. 
03 Preheat the oven to 180Â°C /Gas 4. Line a 900g loaf tin with bakewell paper and pour in the mixture. 
04 Bake for approximately 1 hour until the cake has risen and cooked through. Leave to cool on a rack and store for 2 days before eating. Serve sliced with butter. 
05 This mixture can be doubled to make 2 loaves and will keep for up to 7 days.
06 Warm a little honey to drizzle over the surface of the warm cake for a glazed topping.
